Index View: NIFTY

The market breadth has shown improvement, with the percentage of stocks above the 200-day SMA in the Nifty 500 rising from 10% to 16% over the past two weeks.

The recent pullback in US 10-year yields, the Dollar Index, and Brent crude prices is beneficial for emerging markets. This shift is expected to ease inflationary pressures, which have been a concern, and provide a more favorable economic environment. Additionally, the reduction in these key factors is likely to enhance investor sentiment, boosting confidence in emerging market assets and potentially driving positive market movements in the near future.

Stock market recommendations: According to Bajaj Broking Research, Zydus Lifesciences and National Aluminium are the top stock picks for today. Here’s its view on Nifty, Bank Nifty and the top stock picks for March 21, 2025:Nifty despite ongoing global volatility maintained a positive bias and on expected lines managed to hold above the support area of 22,300 and tested our immediate resistance area of 23,000-23,200. Concerns over trade tensions and fluctuating US policies are creating a challenging environment for traders and investors, which will continue to keep the equity market volatile.Going ahead, we expect the index to gradually move higher towards the 23,500 levels, which aligns with the 200-day moving average. However, after a 1,200-point rally over the past 12 sessions, the daily stochastic indicator is now in overbought territory. As a result, some corrective consolidation around the 23,200-23,250 levels is possible. We believe that any pullback from current levels should be seen as a buying opportunity, as we expect the Nifty to stay above the support zone of 22,400-22,500. Focus should be on accumulating quality stocks (backed by strong earnings) in a staggered manner from a medium-term perspective.Our constructive bias is validated by following observations:Bank Nifty in the last seven sessions witnessed a strong up move of more than 2000 points from the key support area of 48,000-47,700.The index in the last 10 weeks has been consolidating in the broad range of 47,700-50,600. Buying demand has recently emerged from the lower band of the range and we expect the index to head towards the upper band of the range placed at 50,600. We believe a breakout above the upper band will signal a major reversal of corrective trend and can open upside towards 51,500-52,000 levels in the coming weeks.","The percentage of stocks above the 200-day SMA in the Nifty 500 has risen from 10% to 16% over the past two weeks.

Santander UK's announcement on Wednesday that it plans to shut a fifth of its branch network has raised concerns about the bank's future in the UK. The move, which could result in around 750 job losses consist of the closure of 95 out of 444 branches by June.The bank which has faced speculation over its long-term presence in the UK, will retain 349 branches, including 290 full-service locations and 36 branches with reduced hours. Like many other UK banks, Santander has been scaling back its physical presence as customers increasingly turn to digital banking, reported news agency Reuters.Since 2019, the bank has reported a 63% rise in digital transactions, while in-branch financial transactions have declined by 61% over the same period. Despite this, the closures have sparked criticism from UK lawmakers, who argue that they harm local businesses and make it more difficult for vulnerable customers in rural areas to access banking services.In response to these concerns, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) introduced new rules in September to make it more difficult for banks to close branches without ensuring that customers have free access to cash alternatives.Santander UK explained that the decision to close branches was part of its strategy to align with customer behaviour. ""As a business, we must move with customers and balance our investment across all the places where we interact with them,"" said the bank. ""Closing a branch is always a very difficult decision, and we spend a great deal of time assessing where and when we do this and how to minimize the impact on our customers.""The bank added that it is consulting with employee unions and will provide support to affected staff, including assistance with finding alternative roles within the bank.In its most recent financial report, Santander UK posted a 38% drop in annual pre-tax profit, totalling £1.33 billion ($1.73 billion) in 2024. The bank employs approximately 18,000 people.Despite reports in January suggesting that Barclays had explored a potential offer for Santander UK's operations, the parent company reiterated last month that its UK unit remains a key part of its globally diversified business strategy and is not for sale.",Santander UK plans to shut a fifth of its branch network by June.

He stated, ""It is the policy of the department that when you want a good road, you have to pay for it.""The 2008 regulations stipulate that toll plazas on identical national highway sections and directions must maintain a minimum distance of 60 kilometres.Also Read | ‘False’ FASTag wallet toll deduction?

(AI image)

Why is the stock market rising?

1) FIIs Return to D-Street

2) Fed Signal on Rate Cuts

3) Falling US Bond Yields

4) Technical Reasons

Stock market today : BSE Sensex and Nifty50, the Indian equity benchmark indices, rallied strongly in trade on Friday. While BSE Sensex crossed the 77,000 mark intraday, Nifty50 went above 23,400. BSE Sensex closed the day at 76,905.51, up 557 points or 0.73%. Nifty50 ended at 23,355.75, up 165 points or 0.71%.Indian benchmark indices bounced back from initial weakness supported by favourable large-cap valuations and positive sentiment due to reduced foreign selling pressure.The Nifty has shown positive movement in four consecutive sessions, its longest continuous upward trend in approximately seven weeks. Including Friday's increase, it has gained about 4% this week, heading towards its strongest weekly performance since July 2022.Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs) have shifted to buying positions in two out of the last four sessions after consistent selling over months, improving market sentiment. On March 20, FPIs acquired equities worth Rs 3,239 crore, indicating a change in their investment approach, according to an ET report.""The rally in the market this week, which saw the Nifty rise by 3.5%, has come at a time when trade tensions are escalating, and more is expected when the reciprocal tariffs kick in on April 2nd. The main driver of the rally is the buying by FIIs in the cash market over two days and, perhaps more importantly, a sharp decline in their short positions and an increase in long positions in the futures market,"" said Dr. V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Financial Services.The US Federal Reserve maintained steady interest rates while confirming its outlook for two rate reductions by 2025 end, consistent with previous December projections. Despite elevated inflation expectations due to forthcoming tariffs, the anticipated rate cuts have alleviated worries about stringent monetary policy.The potential reduction in US interest rates is expected to result in dollar depreciation and decreased Treasury yields, enhancing the appeal of emerging markets, including India, to international investors.US Treasury yields have experienced a decline, with the 10-year yield decreasing to 4.25% from approximately 4.5% in mid-February, whilst the 2-year yield reduced to 3.97% from 4.28%. The US Dollar Index trading under 104 has additionally bolstered emerging market sentiment.The combination of a softer dollar and reduced US bond yields increases the attractiveness of Indian equities to overseas investors, potentially leading to increased market inflows.Sameet Chavan, Head of Research, Technical and Derivative at Angel One, said, ""Bulls continue to dominate as the Nifty extended gains for the fourth straight session. With strong momentum and evolving price patterns, we expect this rally to continue in the near term.""He observed a definitive breakout from a Falling Channel pattern, accompanied by the RSI surpassing 50, indicating positive momentum shift.Regarding crucial levels, Chavan identified 23,300-23,400 as immediate resistance, followed by 23,800 as the subsequent key level. He specified support levels at 23,000 (50-DEMA) and 22,800 as substantial support zones.","BSE Sensex and Nifty50, the Indian equity benchmark indices, rallied strongly in trade on Friday.

India's startup count to double by 2030: Study,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/indias-startup-count-to-double-by-2030-study/articleshow/119318697.cms,"BENGALURU: India's startup ecosystem is set for rapid expansion, with the number of startups projected to double from 120,000 in 2023 to 240,000 by 2030, according to a new report by executive search firm Longhouse, shared exclusively with TOI.This growth is expected to drive a surge in high-value enterprises, with the number of unicorns-startups valued at over $1 billion-rising from 120 currently to 280 by the end of the decade. The expansion is also poised to have a significant impact on employment, with startups contributing to both direct and indirect job creation across key sectors..The report added the startup ecosystem is projected to create 50 million jobs by 2030, with startups driving a surge in both direct employment and the gig economy. Of these, 4-5 million will be direct white-collar jobs, another 9-10 million in the gig economy, and 35-40 million indirect jobs across sectors. ""A significant portion of these jobs will emerge from newer startups rather than just expansion in existing companies. As India moves from 120 unicorns today to an expected 280 by 2030, most of the employment growth will come from companies that are scaling up rapidly in emerging sectors like AI, SaaS, clean tech, and fintech,"" Rohit Srivastava, senior partner, Longhouse said.The report also highlighted a fundamental shift in the startup founder demographic. Between 2020 and 2024, 40% of unicorn founders had 10-15 years of prior work experience, up from 26% in the 2008-2013 period. Additionally, 55% of unicorn founders held leadership roles before launching their ventures, underscoring the increasing role of domain expertise and industry networks in creating a successful business.The share of unicorn founders with over 20 years of experience also peaked at 30% in recent years, signalling a move towards seasoned entrepreneurs replacing the younger, early-stage founders who once dominated India's startup boom.""Founders today are entering entrepreneurship with deeper industry expertise. The days of fresh-out-of-college unicorn builder are giving way to more seasoned cohort,"" Srivastava added.The study pointed to key industry trends shaping the future of startup landscape. While fintech and enterprise tech continue to dominate the list, AI-led innovation, deeptech, and sustainability-focused startups are gaining investor interest. AI is expected to drive growth across sectors, not only through new startups but also by transforming existing businesses. SaaS is emerging as a strong contender, with more Indian startups scaling into global markets.""AI is both job creator and disruptor. While automation may replace certain routine jobs, it is opening new opportunities in AI development, enterprise transformation, and specialised services. Companies working on AI-driven workflow automation and IT transformation are seeing strong hiring trends,"" Srivastava added.","India's startup ecosystem is set for rapid expansion, with the number of startups projected to double from 120,000 in 2023 to 240,000 by 2030.

Eli Lilly launches weight-loss drug Mounjaro in India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/science/ozempic-like-weight-loss-drug-mounjaro-launched-in-india-all-you-know-to-know/articleshow/119254961.cms,"Rising obesity and diabetes rates in India

PM Modi flags rising obesity in India

Global pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly has launched Mounjaro ( tirzepatide ) in India. The drug, a single-molecule drug designed to bind to and activate both GIP and GLP-1 receptors, helps in regulating regulate blood sugar and metabolism. Approved by the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO), the once-weekly injectable drug offers a novel approach to metabolic health management, targeting both glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptors.Mounjaro is indicated for adults with type 2 diabetes as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve blood sugar control. It is also prescribed for chronic weight management in individuals with a body mass index (BMI) of 30 kg/m2 or greater (obesity) or 27 kg/m2 or greater (overweight) with at least one weight-related condition.Winselow Tucker, President and General Manager of Eli Lilly India, described the dual burden of obesity and type 2 diabetes as a pressing public health challenge in India. ""Lilly is committed to working with the government and industry to increase awareness and improve disease management,"" he said, as reported by news agency PTI.In the SURMOUNT-1 trial, participants taking the highest dose (15 mg) lost an average of 21.8 kg over 72 weeks, while those on the lowest dose (5 mg) lost 15.4 kg, ANI reported. The placebo group, in comparison, lost just 3.2 kg. Similarly, the SURPASS program showed a reduction in A1C levels by up to 2.4%, making it a promising treatment option for diabetes management.Mounjaro is available in India in single-dose vials, with pricing starting at Rs 3,500 for a 2.5 mg vial and Rs 4,375 for a 5 mg vial. Monthly treatment costs range between Rs 14,000 and Rs 17,500, depending on the dosage.Mounjaro’s launch follows the success of other GLP-1 receptor agonists, such as Ozempic (semaglutide), which has gained global recognition for its effectiveness in diabetes and weight management. Ozempic, marketed by Novo Nordisk, works similarly by mimicking hormones that regulate appetite and glucose levels.Recent studies have also suggested that semaglutide may reduce alcohol cravings, a finding that has sparked interest in its potential use beyond weight loss and diabetes treatment. Researchers found that people taking semaglutide consumed nearly 30% less alcohol compared to those on a placebo, reinforcing the idea that GLP-1-based drugs may help manage addiction-related behaviors.India is facing a growing epidemic of diabetes and obesity. Around 101 million Indians live with diabetes, and nearly half struggle with inadequate glycemic control. Meanwhile, obesity affects approximately 100 million adults and is linked to over 200 health complications, including heart disease, hypertension, and sleep apnea.In February, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, during his Mann Ki Baat address, highlighted the growing obesity issue in India, adding that one in every eight people is affected.He urged citizens to reduce their edible oil consumption by 10% monthly to combat obesity, a message he reinforced during his radio address on Sunday.He also shared inspiring messages from Olympic medallist Neeraj Chopra, boxer Nikhat Zareen, and renowned cardiac surgeon Dr Devi Shetty, who supported the initiative by sharing personal experiences.Additionally, the Prime Minister nominated several public figures, including business tycoons and celebrities, to spread awareness and extend the challenge to others.","Mounjaro is a single-molecule drug designed to bind to and activate both GIP and GLP-1 receptors.

Driving the news

Why it matters

India’s dilemma:

China’s overflow problem:

New ‘China Shock’

: India, others in crosshairs

Trump’s trade war is also fueling a second wave of the “China Shock,” a term used by economists to describe the massive economic disruption caused by China’s rise as a manufacturing powerhouse in the early 2000s. Now, as Trump closes the door on Chinese imports, those products are flooding global markets—leading to economic distress in countries from Indonesia to Mexico.

India in the crosshairs: India is feeling the heat. Authorities in New Delhi have launched anti-dumping probes into a range of Chinese products, including solar cells and mobile phone components, to shield domestic industries. Meanwhile, local textile producers are struggling to compete against a flood of inexpensive Chinese garments.

India is feeling the heat. Authorities in New Delhi have launched anti-dumping probes into a range of Chinese products, including solar cells and mobile phone components, to shield domestic industries. Meanwhile, local textile producers are struggling to compete against a flood of inexpensive Chinese garments. The situation in India mirrors what is happening in Mexico and Southeast Asia. As per the Bloomberg report, in Mexico, President Claudia Sheinbaum has linked rising violence in industrial regions to mass layoffs caused by the influx of Chinese goods. “So much of the entry of Chinese products into Mexico caused this industry to fall in our country,” Sheinbaum said.

Indonesia's textile and apparel industry has shed around 250,000 jobs over the past two years, with an additional 500,000 positions projected to be at risk by 2025. This trend would amount to losing roughly one in four industry jobs within just a few years. The pace of these job losses surpasses the so-called ""China Shock,"" during which the US lost as many as 2.4 million jobs between 1999 and 2011.

Thailand has imposed a value-added tax on low-cost Chinese imports. Sanan Angubolkul, the head of Thailand’s Chamber of Commerce, warned that the situation is “very critical, and there’s no time to waste” as the nation deals with a surge of electrical appliances, clothing and other Chinese goods, the Bloomberg report said .

Vietnam has ordered Chinese e-commerce giants to suspend operations.

In Indonesia, garment manufacturers are struggling to compete with cheap Chinese textiles. The Indonesia Fiber and Filament Yarn Producer Association estimates that one in four jobs in the sector could disappear this year.

What they’re saying

Trump’s latest trade moves have sparked strong reactions from business leaders, economists, and government officials:

Donald Trump, on trade negotiations: “We have a powerful group of partners in trade. Again, we can’t let those partners treat us badly… The ones that wouldn’t be as friendly to us in some cases treat us better than the ones that are supposed to be friendly.”

Howard Lutnick, US commerce Ssecretary: “These policies are the most important thing America has ever had… It is worth it.”

Henrietta Treyz, economic analyst: “Markets remain skittish because this isn’t just about China anymore. Trump’s April 2 tariffs will hit everyone.”

Brian Coulton, Fitch chief economist: “Tariff hikes will result in higher US consumer prices, reduce real wages, and increase companies’ costs.”

""This is China Shock 2.0 or China Shock 3.0. China has this immense manufacturing capacity, and the goods have to go somewhere"" Gordon Hanson, a professor of urban policy at the Harvard Kennedy School, told Bloomberg.

Zoom In: India’s trade battle

India, which is both a competitor and a partner to China, faces unique challenges in this trade war:

The country’s automotive, chemical, and electronics sectors have benefited from Trump’s tariffs on China, as US firms seek alternative suppliers.

However, India also imports heavily from China, meaning that any trade barriers on Chinese goods could raise costs for Indian manufacturers.

Trump’s demand for reciprocal tariffs puts India in a difficult position. If India refuses, it risks losing access to the lucrative US market. But if it complies, domestic industries—especially agriculture and small businesses—could suffer.

What’s next

As the April 2 tariff deadline approaches, several key developments could shape the outcome:

India’s concessions: The Modi government is in talks to lower more tariffs, but it remains unclear if these moves will be enough to satisfy Trump.

China’s retaliation: If China feels further cornered, it could step up its trade offensive, worsening the economic fallout for other countries.

Global recession fears: Economists warn that escalating trade tensions could push the world closer to a recession, with inflation rising and investment slowing.

The bottom line

US President Donald Trump is escalating his global trade war, targeting not just China but also allies like India. As part of his ""America First"" economic strategy, Trump announced that India will face reciprocal tariffs starting April 2, claiming that the country imposes some of the highest duties on US goods.Meanwhile, his crackdown on Beijing is triggering a new ""China Shock,"" as excess Chinese exports flood global markets, disrupting industries and destroying jobs worldwide, a Bloomberg report said. The world’s largest exporter, facing increased trade barriers in the US, is flooding other markets with cheap goods—undercutting local manufacturers and eliminating jobs from Mexico to Indonesia to India.In an interview with Breitbart News, Trump said that while India is a “wonderful nation,” it has tariffs that are unfair to the US. “I have a very good relationship with India, but the only problem I have is they’re one of the highest tariffing nations in the world,” he said. “I believe they’re going to probably be lowering those tariffs substantially, but on April 2, we will be charging them the same tariffs they charge us.”On China, Trump is taking an even more aggressive stance, arguing that Beijing’s economic expansion is hurting American workers and destabilizing industries worldwide. His latest tariffs are designed to curb China’s influence, but they are also causing widespread disruptions in other economies that rely on trade with China.The economic fallout is already visible in Southeast Asia, where Chinese exports—redirected from the US due to tariffs—are undercutting local businesses.Trump’s tariff war is not just a US-China showdown—it’s reshaping global trade patterns, forcing countries like India to make tough choices and wreaking havoc on emerging markets:While Prime Minister Narendra Modi has cultivated strong ties with Trump, India is scrambling to reduce trade tensions. In recent weeks, it has lowered duties on bourbon, high-end motorcycles, and certain agricultural goods. More tariff reductions could follow as Indian officials work to avoid a full-scale trade war with the US.With US import barriers rising, Chinese manufacturers are aggressively seeking new markets. The result? An oversupply of Chinese goods in countries like Indonesia, Mexico, and Brazil, putting pressure on local producers.A global economic risk: Trump’s tariffs have already rattled markets. As April 2 approaches, uncertainty is growing, with investors worried about inflation and supply chain disruptions. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell recently noted, “Uncertainty is remarkably high.”Trump’s tariff war is reshaping the global economic order. India is trying to navigate a delicate balance, China is flooding markets with cheap goods, and developing nations are facing a fresh wave of job losses. With April 2 looming, the world is watching to see whether Trump’s hardball tactics will succeed—or whether they will trigger an even bigger economic crisis.(With inputs from agencies)","Trump’s trade war is fueling a second wave of the “China Shock,” a term used by economists to describe the massive economic disruption caused by China's rise as a manufacturing powerhouse in the early 2000s.

Ben & Jerry’s argued this decision violated the terms of its merger agreement, which requires consultation with an advisory committee from its board before any CEO can be removed.Unilever, headquartered in London, responded on Wednesday, expressing disappointment over the public nature of the dispute.“Regrettably, despite repeated attempts to engage the board and follow the correct process, we are disappointed that the confidentiality of an employee career conversation has been made public,” the company said in a statement.Unilever acquired Ben & Jerry’s in 2000 for $326 million, with the ice cream brand hoping the partnership would strengthen its social mission. However, tensions between the two companies have escalated in recent years.In 2021, Ben & Jerry’s announced it would no longer sell its products in Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem. The following year, Unilever sold its Israeli operations to a local company, which continued selling Ben & Jerry’s under its Hebrew and Arabic branding across Israel and the West Bank.Unilever has since revealed plans to spin off its entire ice cream division, including Ben & Jerry’s, by the end of 2025 as part of a wider restructuring. The consumer goods giant also owns brands such as Dove soap and Hellmann’s mayonnaise.The strained relationship took another hit last November when Ben & Jerry’s sued Unilever in a New York federal court, accusing it of attempting to silence the company’s statements supporting Palestinians in the Gaza war.The complaint also alleged that Unilever blocked Ben & Jerry’s from posting about issues it expected to be challenged in a potential second term for Donald Trump, including minimum wage policies, universal healthcare, abortion rights, and climate change.Tuesday’s filing marked an amendment to that ongoing lawsuit, further expanding the gap between the ice cream brand and its parent company.","Unilever acquired Ben & Jerry’s in 2000 for $326 million, with the ice cream brand hoping the partnership would strengthen its social mission.

MUMBAI: India remains the most cost-effective destination for remittances, yet recipients still lose around 5% of the money sent by relatives abroad in transfer costs.According to a Reserve Bank of India (RBI) study, the global average cost of sending $200 has fallen (from nearly 9.7% in 2009 to around 6.7% in Q2 2024) but remains above the G20's 5% target and the UN's 3% Sustainable Development Goal (SDG). These costs include fees and exchange-rate markups.India has, however, met the G20 target. Remittance costs were 4.9% in 2023, and just over 5% in the first half of 2024 - below the global average. India is the top recipient, followed by Mexico, China, the Philippines, France, Pakistan, and Bangladesh.Digital remittances, which were 30% of transactions in Q2 2024, are cheaper. India's digital transfers averaged 4%, a percentage point below the national average, ""reflecting the rising role of digitalisation in optimising remittance costs"".Smaller transfers are pricier. Remittances under $200 averaged 4.6%, while $200-$500 transfers were 2.4%. Fintech firms and money-transfer operators (MTOs) offer the lowest costs, increasing competition.Advanced economies (AEs) now account for over half of India's $118 billion in FY24 remittances, while Gulf states make up 38%.","India remains the most cost-effective destination for remittances.

Microsoft Corp, the biggest backer of Sam Altman's OpenAI , and BlackRock Inc, which has an executive on the artificial intelligence startup's board, are joining forces with one of his chief rivals.Microsoft and BlackRock said on Wednesday that Elon Musk's xAI is joining their effort to build $30 billion worth of data centers and other artificial intelligence infrastructure. The AI chipmaker Nvidia Corp, which was already named as a technical adviser to the group when it was announced last year, is also formally joining, according to a statement that didn't detail member commitments.Microsoft, which has invested about $13 billion in OpenAI, has increasingly been developing AI outside of that partnership. The software giant has created in-house AI models that it believes can compete with OpenAI, Bloomberg reported this month. Musk, also a co-founder of OpenAI, has meanwhile publicly feuded with Altman over the company's efforts to shift to a for-profit structure.The capital demands and enthusiasm for AI have prompted a range of companies and investors to forge alliances to build some of the biggest data centre campuses in the world. US President Donald Trump has touted hundreds of billions of dollars worth of commitments from firms including Softbank Group and OpenAI, which are behind a $100 billion AI investment plan dubbed Stargate.The Microsoft-backed group will be renamed the AI Infrastructure Partnership , or AIP, and focus on infrastructure investments - including energy projects - mostly in the US, with a portion of the funds to be deployed in partner countries, according to the companies. The plan foresees bringing on additional investors. Clients, including pensions and insurers, are eager for such long-term infrastructure projects, BlackRock chief executive officer Larry Fink said in the statement.BlackRock and Microsoft last year unveiled the coalition in partnership with MGX, a UAE investment vehicle that is also involved in Stargate, and Bayo Ogunlesi's Global Infrastructure Partners. The companies said at the time they would seek $30 billion of private equity capital over an unspecified time frame and eventually leverage as much as $100 billion in potential investments.","Microsoft and BlackRock said on Wednesday that Elon Musk's xAI is joining their effort to build $30 billion worth of data centers and other artificial intelligence infrastructure.

The federal reserve maintained its benchmark interest rate on Wednesday, keeping it unchanged for the second consecutive meeting, while signalling that it still expects to cut rates twice before the end of the year. However, officials acknowledged growing uncertainty in the economic outlook as inflation shows signs of persistence and growth projections weaken.In its latest quarterly economic forecast, the Fed revised its expectations for economic growth, predicting a slower expansion this year and next compared to previous estimates. The central bank also anticipates a slight increase in the unemployment rate, projecting it to rise to 4.4% by the end of 2025. Inflation, which remains above the Fed's 2% target, is expected to climb to 2.7% this year from its current level of 2.5%.""Uncertainty around the economic outlook has increased,"" Fed noted in its post-meeting statement, highlighting the delicate balance policymakers must strike. While rising inflation would typically prompt the Fed to keep rates elevated or even raise them, slowing growth and rising unemployment could necessitate rate cuts to support the economy.The decision to hold rates steady comes as the central bank assesses the broader impact of the Trump administration's economic policies, particularly tariffs. Economists predict that new trade barriers could temporarily push inflation higher, while other measures, such as deregulation, may offset some of those effects by reducing costs.Fed chair Jerome Powell acknowledged that tariffs have begun to influence inflation, particularly through higher costs on imported goods.""I do think with the arrival of tariff inflation, further progress [on lowering inflation] is probably delayed,"" Powell said during a news conference.Alongside the rate decision, Fed announced a slowdown in the pace at which it is reducing its holdings of US treasury securities.Previously, the central bank allowed $25 billion in treasuries to mature each month without reinvesting the proceeds. Now, it will reinvest more aggressively, limiting the monthly runoff to just $5 billion.This move aims to keep long-term borrowing costs lower by stabilizing Treasury yields, which dipped slightly following the announcement.Despite Fed's efforts to manage inflation, concerns are growing among economists and consumers alike. Analysts at Goldman Sachs predict that inflation could climb to 3% by the end of the year, up from 2.6% currently, largely driven by import taxes.Consumer sentiment also reflects growing caution, with recent surveys indicating that Americans expect inflation to worsen. If these expectations persist, they could lead to self-fulfilling price increases as people rush to make purchases before costs rise further. Retailers and homebuilders have already signalled potential price hikes on goods and services due to the added pressure of tariffs.While inflation remains a key concern, signs of economic slowdown are also emerging. The economy has shown weaker growth in early 2025, with Barclays cutting its GDP forecast to just 0.7%, down from an earlier projection of 2.5% in 2024.With inflation still above target, growth slowing, and tariffs complicating the economic landscape, the Fed's path forward remains uncertain. Policymakers have signalled rate cuts on the horizon, but the timing and extent of those reductions will depend on how economic conditions evolve in the coming months.","The federal reserve maintained its benchmark interest rate on Wednesday, keeping it unchanged for the second consecutive meeting.

The US Federal Reserve kept the benchmark rate unchanged in the 4.25-4.5% range in its meeting today. ""In support of its goals, the Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 4-1/4 to 4-1/2 percent. In considering the extent and timing of additional adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks,"" the statement read.""Recent indicators suggest that economic activity has continued to expand at a solid pace. The unemployment rate has stabilized at a low level in recent months, and labor market conditions remain solid. Inflation remains somewhat elevated. The Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run. Uncertainty around the economic outlook has increased. The Committee is attentive to the risks to both sides of its dual mandate,"" the FOMC statement read.Federal Reserve officials maintained their projection of two interest rate reductions in 2025, whilst revising their growth estimates downwards for 2025 and increasing their inflation predictions.The US central bank officials suggested they continue to expect a reduction in borrowing costs by 50 basis points before year-end, considering the anticipated economic slowdown and eventual decline in inflation rates.The Fed's outlook for inflation saw an upward revision, with their preferred price increase measure projected to reach 2.7% by year-end, compared to the previously forecasted 2.5% in December. The Federal Reserve maintains an inflation target of 2%.Additionally, they reduced the US GDP growth forecast for the current year from 2.1% to 1.7%, alongside predictions of a marginally higher unemployment rate by the end of this year.""In assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee’s goals. The Committee’s assessments will take into account a wide range of information, including readings on labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments,"" the statement added.Most market analysts expected the Federal Reserve to maintain its current interest rate whilst monitoring economic developments. The job market appears stable, following robust economic performance at the end of last year.There is considerable ambiguity regarding the economic impact of US President Donald Trump's policies. His stated objectives include revitalising domestic manufacturing and reducing federal workforce numbers.The constant stream of policy declarations from Trump regarding tariffs and other measures has generated significant economic uncertainty. Economists are concerned this might lead American businesses and consumers to reduce their expenditure.Should economic conditions deteriorate, the Federal Reserve maintains the option to stimulate growth through interest rate reductions, as demonstrated in previous economic downturns. With the primary interest rate currently ranging between 4.25% and 4.50%, there remains substantial scope for adjustment.Also Read | Is a US recession coming? 7 charts that show the plight of the American economy However, as pointed out in an Associated Press report, the US Federal Reserve faces a more complex scenario in its current decision-making process. Whilst reducing interest rates would stimulate the economy, it could simultaneously drive inflation higher, particularly concerning given the existing tariff-related inflationary pressures.The Fed lacks effective mechanisms to address ""stagflation,"" a situation characterised by economic stagnation coupled with persistent high inflation, the report notes.Interest rate reductions, previously viewed as positive responses to inflation approaching the Fed's 2% target, might now be perceived negatively. These cuts could become necessary to counteract economic challenges stemming from widespread tariffs, substantial reductions in government expenditure, and heightened economic uncertainty.Also Read | Trump tariffs impact: Is a US recession likely and does India need to worry about it? Meanwhile, US GDP growth projections have undergone significant downward revisions, with Barclays adjusting its growth forecast to 0.7%, a substantial decrease from 2.5% in 2024.

XRP price surges 11% as SEC ends appeal in Ripple’s legal battle,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/xrp-surges-11-as-sec-ends-appeal-in-ripples-legal-battle/articleshow/119222809.cms,"XRP

XRP saw a surge after Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse revealed that the US Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) is no longer pursuing its appeal in the ongoing legal case against the payments company. As a result, XRP's price jumped nearly 11%, reaching $2.52.Speaking at the Digital Assets Summit in New York on Wednesday morning, Garlinghouse reflected on the nearly four-year-long legal battle, according to CNBC.""It’s been almost four years and about three months since the SEC originally sued us, certainly a painful journey in lots of ways,"" he said. ""I really deeply believed that we were going to be on the right side of the law and on the right side of history.""Garlinghouse criticized the SEC, stating, ""The system just feels broken. That we had to fight this fight for the industry and you had an SEC attacking the industry, particularly the Ripple case. There were no victims, there was no investor loss. They were just not acting in good faith.""In 2020, the SEC filed a lawsuit against Ripple, accusing the company of violating US securities laws by selling XRP without registering it. Ripple achieved a partial victory in 2023 when US District Judge Analisa Torres ruled in favor of the company, a decision celebrated as a landmark for the crypto industry .While XRP was not deemed a security when sold to retail investors on exchanges, it was considered an unregistered security offering when sold to institutional investors.This development comes as the SEC moves swiftly to address its previous administration's actions, which had a significant impact on the crypto industry.Last month, the SEC ended its enforcement case against Coinbase, closed investigations into Robinhood's crypto unit, Uniswap, Gemini, and ConsenSys without taking enforcement action, scaled back its crypto enforcement unit, and clarified that meme coins are not considered securities. Additionally, the SEC's newly formed crypto task force is launching a roundtable series to discuss and define the security status of digital assets.XRP, created by Ripple's founders in 2012, is the native token of the XRP Ledger , which Ripple uses for cross-border payments. Approximately 95% of Ripple's business takes place outside the US, and the company is the largest holder of XRP. The token has seen a tremendous rise, up more than 390% since the postelection Trump trade, and has gained 20% in value this year.","Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse revealed that the SEC is no longer pursuing its appeal in the ongoing legal case against the payments company.

The EU will reduce steel imports by a further 15 percent from April, the bloc's industry chief said Wednesday, to prevent a wave of cheap steel flooding the market after the United States imposed new levies.US President Donald Trump slapped 25-percent tariffs on imports of steel and aluminium, raising fears of the knock-on effects for Europe's beleaguered steel industry, already facing fierce competition from Asia and high energy prices.""On April 1, we will reinforce the current safeguard clause. We're aiming for a drop of up to 15 percent in imports,"" European Commission vice president Stephane Sejourne said as he unveiled a medley of measures to protect the metals sector.The commission already has safeguard measures -- including import limits -- in place to protect the steel industry, that will continue until 2026.The European steel industry currently employs more than 300,000 people -- but has lost almost 100,000 jobs in the past 15 years. Industry group Eurofer welcomed the measures.""We are grateful that the Commission has clearly recognised the strategic importance of the European steel industry to the EU's sovereignty, security, and competitiveness,"" said Henrik Adam, Eurofer president.But he warned ""energy remains the elephant in the room"" and urged the EU to do more to reduce energy costs in Europe.Brussels will also launch an investigation into aluminium on the European market, ""with a view to introducing a safeguard clause similar to that for steel"", Sejourne said.The probe would look at whether there has been a sudden increase in aluminium imports, which could lead to import curbs.""US tariffs on aluminium are likely to worsen the situation further given the significant threat of trade diversion from multiple destinations,"" the commission said.","The EU will reduce steel imports by a further 15 percent from April, the bloc's industry chief says.

Indian airline IndiGo announced plans on Wednesday to increase its international flight capacity by fiscal year 2030 in an effort to capture a larger market share.The no-frills carrier intends to raise its international capacity share—measured as the proportion of total available seat kilometres dedicated to international routes—from the current 28% to 40%, news agency Reuters reported. This shift marks a significant growth from just 14% in fiscal year 2018, achieved in a span of seven years.IndiGo currently flies to 40 international destinations and holds a 19% share of India’s international flight market, according to the latest data from the country’s aviation regulator. Following the announcement, shares of the airline rose by 4.2%.This international expansion comes as IndiGo seeks to diversify beyond its dominant domestic market, where it holds nearly 60% of the share. The move aligns with the broader trend of Indian carriers working to meet the growing demand for both domestic and international air travel, despite challenges related to aircraft supply.Earlier this year, IndiGo revealed plans to strengthen its international presence, which currently generates around 10% of its revenue. The airline also announced plans to lease a Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner from Norse Atlantic Airways to expand its long-haul operations.IndiGo is looking to add business class seats to its Airbus A321XLR and A350 aircraft to further increase revenue, as business class tickets are priced roughly three times higher than economy class.The airline began offering business class seats on select domestic routes late last year, marking its first move away from an all-economy cabin model, and is positioning itself to capitalize on the growing demand for premium travel among Indian passengers.IndiGo also reaffirmed its goal of expanding its fleet to over 600 aircraft by 2030, up from approximately 437 currently.","Indian airline IndiGo plans to increase its international flight capacity by fiscal year 2030.

Google parent Alphabet agreed to acquire cloud security firm Wiz for $32 billion in cash, reaching a deal less than a year after initial negotiations fell apart because the cloud-computing startup wanted to stay independent.Wiz will join the Google Cloud business once the deal closes, the companies said in a statement on Tuesday. The takeover is subject to regulatory approvals and is likely to close next year, they said.The deal, which would be Alphabet’s largest to date, comes after Wiz turned down a $23 billion bid from the internet search leader last year after several months of discussions. At the time, Wiz walked away after deciding it could ultimately be worth more by pursuing an initial public offering company. Concerns about regulatory challenges also influenced the decision.Shares of Alphabet fell nearly 3% in New York on Tuesday.The Wiz takeover is by far the largest M&A deal to be announced this year. Deal hungry companies and their advisers had initially predicted that US President Donald Trump’s policies would create better conditions for buying and selling, supercharging an M&A market that just got back on its feet after a lull. Instead, his tariff threats and geopolitical tensions have spooked markets and kept dealmakers in wait-and-see mode.Google framed the Wiz ac quisition as a way to beef up its cloud security offerings with new ways to keep their systems secure in a new era of Artificial Intelligence.“AI brings new risks, but also new opportunities,” Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai said in a call with investors. “Organisations are looking for cybersecurity solutions that improve cloud security and span multiple clouds.”","Wiz will join the Google Cloud business once the deal closes, the companies said.

Is a US recession coming? 7 charts that show the plight of the American economy,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/is-a-us-recession-coming-7-charts-that-show-the-plight-of-the-american-economy/articleshow/119167257.cms,"Is the US economy headed for a downturn? (AI image)

“The trends indicate that the jump in US economy post COVID may have been an outlier as a result of policy extravaganza…. Long trends indicate possible downturn in US economy,” says SBI in its latest report.

US Real GDP growth in long run

Drastically cutting Federal spending can be disastrous, says SBI report

What US economic data is pointing to

1) GDP growth trajectory:

The US economy has weakened over the past year, with GDP growth declining from 3.2% in Q4 2023 to 2.5% in Q4 2024, notes the SBI report.

2) Debt:

The debt to GDP ratio shows a secular rising trend, says SBI.

3) Reduced exports, consumption:

Extended analysis suggests a probable decline in US economic growth, accompanied by reduced exports and consumption.

4) Savings to GDP ratio:

US Consumer Spending Drop

5) Stock market mayhem:

P/E multiples are stretched for most markets

US economy: What’s the long-term outlook?

The US economy long-term trends in GDP indicate decline in potential GDP, demand and investments

The US indebtedness has sharply increased over the years, crowding out the private sector

Although high debt has not reflected in US dollar, which shows cyclical trends its strength has over the years has declined

The current tariff policy will have short term pain and US GDP will not see acceleration in material way

The economic rational of US DOGE is evident from long-term term trends

If the structural adjustment gains traction, then potential GDP trend can see a upward shift. The larger national savings that come from exercise despite nominal improvement in productivity can still push the potential GDP up. The crowding in of the private sector that follows along with technical progress can add significantly to growth prospects. However, this adjustment will have short term costs.

Is the US economy headed for a recession? A recession happens when an economy’s GDP contracts for two consecutive quarters. A recent SBI Research report says that the long term US GDP growth shows a declining trend.Concerns have risen about the economic outlook of the US post Trump’s tariff measures and cutting of spending and jobs. Economists view Trump's trade conflict as a potential threat to the American economy, with possible consequences of increased consumer costs, reduced economic growth and diminished employment opportunities.The report also cautions that, “the zealotry mission of departments like DOGE can undo a lot of ground works done in the previous decades, putting downward pressure on the beleaguered economy.” DOGE or the Department of Government Efficiency is an initiative of the US President Donald Trump and is headed by Tesla CEO and Trump advisor Elon Musk.The economic uncertainty looms large, particularly noteworthy as it follows a period when the US economy demonstrated remarkable strength whilst managing the COVID pandemic crisis. So is the US economy headed for a recession? We take a look at some important data pointers in the SBI report on and the expected trends in the US economy based on long-term history:Analysis of US GDP growth reveals a downward trajectory, particularly evident since 2000, says the SBI report. America’s economic indicators suggest a reduction in potential GDP, alongside weakening demand and investment patterns.“The GDP Now model estimate from Atlanta Fed for real GDP growth (seasonally adjusted annual rate, running estimate) in the first quarter of 2025 is -2.4% on 06 Mar, down from +2.9% on 31 Jan (first estimate),” says the report.Rising national debt levels have become increasingly significant, resulting in diminished private sector participation. Current trade policies involving tariffs are expected to create immediate challenges, without substantial improvement in GDP performance.Post-COVID US economic growth appears exceptional, attributed to extensive policy measures.Total factor productivity growth is diminishing, while value addition shows negative progression. Elevated wage levels might deter future investments. The savings-to-GDP ratio has reached its lowest point since 2011, marking the second-lowest figure since 1951.January witnessed the first decline in consumer spending in nearly 24 months, whilst the goods trade deficit reached unprecedented levels due to businesses accelerating imports to avoid tariff implications, suggesting possible economic contraction this quarter. Consumer expenditure trends are expected to weaken in correlation with the projected overall GDP slowdown.The S&P 500 has given up its post-November election gains, with March 2025 projected to record the poorest monthly performance since the COVID-19 period.US markets, including the S&P with a market capitalisation of approximately 52.9 trillion (February 2025), appear to have reached their limits after delivering exceptional returns. Investors are reassessing earnings forecasts amidst persistent volatility. The prominent 'magnificent 7' stocks display vulnerability following the Deep Seek event, with traditionally stable companies like Apple facing scrutiny of their safe-haven status, says the SBI report.Investment flows are shifting towards more affordable markets as investors seek enhanced returns, evidenced by increased activity in mainland China and Hong Kong markets. Analysts anticipate possible corrections in overvalued markets. The ongoing series of reciprocal tariffs creates conditions for increased market instability in forthcoming periods.The SBI report says that positive structural adjustments could potentially elevate GDP trends. Despite modest productivity improvements, increased national savings could enhance potential GDP. Private sector re-engagement combined with technological advancements could boost growth prospects, though initial adaptation periods may present challenges. The SBI report notes the following:","Long trends indicate possible downturn in US economy, says SBI in its latest report. Long term trends in GDP indicate decline in potential GDP, demand and investments. US indebtedness has sharply increased over the years, crowding out the private sector. Current tariff policy will have short term pain.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-119169633,imgsize-43404,width-400,resizemode-4/119169633.jpg"

Solana meme coins , once the stars of 2024, have seen their market caps decline in recent months. However, one standout project is defying the trend. Solaxy ’s crypto presale is rapidly approaching the $30 million mark, undeterred by the broader market downturn.Unlike typical meme coins, Solaxy aims to go beyond fleeting hype, positioning itself as a game-changer for the Solana ecosystem with its ambitious layer-2 scaling solution .The Solana meme coin market has been quiet for a while now. The tokens that captured massive attention in 2024 are losing value.BONK, for example, has seen a steep 45% drop on the monthly chart. From one of last year’s hottest tokens, it is at risk of being another forgetful meme coin.But it’s not just the Solana meme coin market that is suffering. Significant members of the market like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu have also seen a sharp decline. The overall crypto market is in a downtrend, with Bitcoin slipping under $90,000. On top of that, Solana’s frequent congestion issues are driving users and developers away. While the network was a hot hub for meme coins in 2024, its rising transaction fees and slow processing times are making it less attractive for new projects. Solaxy brings real utility to the Solana network. It is developing Solana’s first-ever Layer-2 scaling solution.The project’s goal is to address the blockchain’s congestion issues head-on by processing transactions off-chain. After that, they are batched for final verification.The mechanism could significantly reduce the strain on Solana’s mainnet by lowering transaction fees and expediting processing speeds.Even during peak trading hours, Solaxy could help keep the network frictionless.Beyond scalability, Solaxy has bigger ambitions. According to its white paper, the project plans to introduce cross-chain functionality between Solana and Ethereum.In other words, it is not just another scaling tool. It has the potential to bridge major blockchain ecosystems, unlocking opportunities in NFTs , gaming, and DeFi.Solaxy’s growing popularity indicates that investors are ready to back innovative projects despite the bearish market. Influential crypto voices like Austin Hilton have taken notice of the project, highlighting its core features.Even as the broader market struggles, Solaxy is gaining strong momentum.Solaxy is currently priced at just $0.001648, while Solana is selling for $130. The price difference presents a significant upside for early investors.While Solana has a $65 billion market cap, Solaxy’s starting valuation leaves substantial room for potential growth. The presale price is a major attraction for early investors.The incentives don’t stop there. Early adopters can benefit from Solaxy’s passive rewards program. It allows investors to earn by locking their tokens. Solaxy’s current annual percentage yield (APY) stands at around 150%, presenting an opportunity for investors seeking long-term gains. More than 6.5 billion tokens have been locked into the protocol so far. With 25% of the supply set aside for community rewards, the team shows commitment to stability. The strategy could reduce early-stage sell-offs and lay a robust path for growth.Security is another factor working in Solaxy’s favour.

"How to deal with Trump: Flattery, retaliation, or holding out?",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/how-to-deal-with-trump-flattery-retaliation-or-holding-out/articleshow/119121261.cms,"Trump has consistently portrayed himself as an excellent dealmaker.

Why it matters

Trump’s America First approach is forcing allies to rethink their economic and military dependencies. Countries that once assumed Washington was a reliable partner are now questioning whether Trump’s transactional style leaves them vulnerable.

Economic risks: Retaliatory tariffs could escalate into a full-scale trade war, disrupting supply chains and rattling financial markets.

Retaliatory tariffs could escalate into a full-scale trade war, disrupting supply chains and rattling financial markets. Diplomatic d ilemmas: Nations must decide whether to challenge Trump’s rhetoric publicly or attempt to negotiate exemptions quietly.

Nations must decide whether to challenge Trump’s rhetoric publicly or attempt to negotiate exemptions quietly. Security concerns: Trump’s threats to Nato and his unpredictable foreign policy approach have left many allies, particularly in Europe, rethinking their military strategies.

The big picture

1. Canada’s aggressive retaliation

When Trump imposed a 25% tariff on Canadian steel and aluminum, Canada struck back with tariffs on US goods and a fee hike on electricity exports to the US.

imposed a 25% tariff on Canadian steel and aluminum, Canada struck back with tariffs on US goods and a fee hike on electricity exports to the US. Trump responded with threats to double Canada’s tariffs, sparking a fiery exchange with Ontario Premier Doug Ford . Both sides eventually walked back their actions, but tensions remain high.

. Both sides eventually walked back their actions, but tensions remain high. The risk? The confrontation led to economic instability, with Canadian markets reacting negatively to the trade war, the Politico report said.

2. Mexico’s quiet diplomacy

Unlike Canada, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum has avoided retaliatory measures and has instead sought behind-the-scenes negotiations.

Sheinbaum has held off on retaliating against Trump’s fentanyl-related tariffs and the new steel and aluminum tariffs, hoping to negotiate exemptions.

The risk? Mexico’s passive approach has yet to yield major wins, and Trump’s administration still sees Mexico as an easy target, the Politico report added.

3. Europe’s coordinated response

The EU is retaliating in phases, announcing a two-stage tariff plan targeting $28 billion in US goods, set to begin on April 1.

Trump falsely claimed on Truth Social that the EU had already implemented a 50% tariff on whiskey, vowing to hit French wines and champagnes with a 200% tariff in response.

The risk? A full-scale trade war between the EU and the US could disrupt global markets and deepen the economic divide between Western allies.

4. China’s strategic patience?

Unlike other countries, China’s rhetoric has been high but response has been measured, allowing space for negotiations.

Beijing is believed to be pursuing a new trade deal, similar to the 2020 agreement during Trump’s first term.

The risk? A full-blown US-China trade war would really hit the world economy hard.

5. The UK and Japan’s cautious approach

The UK has refused to retaliate, with Prime Minister Keir Starmer sending trade officials to Washington to negotiate exemptions.

Japan and Australia are following a similar path, opting for quiet diplomacy instead of direct confrontation.

The risk? While this approach may prevent economic escalation, it also allows Trump to set the terms of the trade dispute unchallenged.

6. India: A different approach

India’s approach reflects a strategic blend of diplomacy, economic pragmatism, and a focus on safeguarding its domestic interests. Recent moves like slashing motorcycle tariffs and dropping retaliatory duties on US agricultural goods in 2023 signal India’s willingness to make concessions to de-escalate tensions.

At the same time, India is engaged in active bilateral negotiations, aiming to finalize a mutually beneficial trade agreement.

What they are saying

William Reinsch, former US commerce official, told Politico: “Is it better to grovel and kiss the ring or stand up to the bully? Both have worked on occasion and both have failed. So it’s hard to know in any given circumstance which one is the better tactic.”

EU trade chief Maros Sefcovic: “There’s still time for the US to settle this without unnecessary pain.”

Commerce secretary Howard Lutnick: “Europe and Canada do not respect Trump or America’s ability to build its steel and aluminum industry.”

Mexico’s former US ambassador, Arturo Sarukhán: “More aggressive responses, like Canada’s and the EU’s, could backfire.”

Between the lines

Not only tariffs, Trump’s Nato stance is also alarming US allies. His remark that he would “encourage” Russia to attack Nato members who fail to meet defense spending targets has left European nations deeply concerned.

Meanwhile, Canada is pivoting towards Europe. Prime Minister Mark Carney’s first foreign visit was to France and the UK, signaling a shift away from dependence on the US.

Germany is increasing defense spending to counter Trump’s unpredictability, committing billions to military expansion in response to his Nato skepticism.

Germany has announced historic defense spending, breaking from its post-WWII reluctance.

Some European leaders are considering an independent nuclear deterrent, possibly involving France and the UK.

Canada is reinforcing its Arctic presence, fearing Trump’s annexation rhetoric.

What’s next

April 2 is the next flashpoint. Trump’s reciprocal tariffs will take effect, potentially triggering more retaliatory measures.

Canada and the EU may accelerate new trade alliances to reduce dependence on the US.

Mexico’s wait-and-see strategy could pay off if Trump offers exemptions, but risks looking weak.

Nato members may push for alternative defense structures, anticipating further US disengagement.

As US President Donald Trump imposes tariffs and shakes up long-standing alliances, world leaders are testing different approaches to dealing with his unpredictable style. From Mexico to Canada to China to EU, different nations and leaders have pursued starkly different strategies with mixed results.With a fresh wave of tariffs on steel and aluminum in effect and more reciprocal tariffs looming in April, other nations are watching closely. Should they retaliate forcefully, like Canada and the EU, or opt for quiet diplomacy, like Mexico and the UK? The answer could determine the global economic and security landscape for years to come.According to a Politico report, countries are adopting different tactics to deal with Trump’s aggressive economic policies, each with its own set of risks and rewards:(With inputs from agencies)",Trump’s America First approach is forcing allies to rethink their economic and military dependencies. Nations must decide whether to challenge Trump publicly or attempt to negotiate exemptions quietly. A full-scale trade war could disrupt global markets and deepen the economic divide between Western allies.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-119121486,imgsize-33234,width-400,resizemode-4/119121486.jpg"
"Will Bitcoin price crash to $20,000? Peter Schiff makes big prediction if Nasdaq enters bear market phase",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/will-bitcoin-price-crash-to-20000-peter-schiff-makes-big-prediction-if-nasdaq-enters-bear-market-phase/articleshow/119107096.cms,"Regarding Bitcoin's potential decline, Schiff observed that with the Nasdaq already showing a 12% decrease.

Below is the full text of Peter Schiff’s post on X:

The NASDAQ is down 12%. If this correction turns out to be a bear market, and the correlation where a 12% decline in the NASDAQ equates to a 24% decline in Bitcoin holds, when the NASDAQ is down 20%, Bitcoin will be about $65K.

But if the NASDAQ goes into a bear market, history shows that the decline will be much larger. Following the bursting of the Dot-com bubble, it fell almost 80%. During the 2008 GFC, it fell 55%, and during the COVID crash in 2020, it fell about 30%. The average of those three bear markets is a 55% decline. If this bear market bottoms with just a 40% decline, that would put Bitcoin at about $20K. However, my bet would be that a drop of that magnitude would accelerate Bitcoin's collapse to much lower levels.

On the other hand, the correlation between the NASDAQ and gold has been negative. Since the NASDAQ peaked on Dec. 16th, 2023, gold is up 13%, almost a perfect 1-to-1 correlation. So, if that correlation holds too, a 40% drop in the NASDAQ would put gold over $3,800. However, my guess is that if a bear market in stocks coincides with a significant decline in the dollar on foreign exchange markets, gold will rise much higher.

But even at $3,800 gold and $20K Bitcoin, in terms of gold, Bitcoin will be down over 85%. Given that such a divergence will likely end the pretense that Bitcoin is a store of value similar to gold, there will clearly be no justification for the U.S. government or any state government to keep any Bitcoin in a Strategic Reserve. There will also be no reason for ETF investors to keep holding their positions either. With all that selling, it will be impossible for $MSTR to sell enough Bitcoin to avoid bankruptcy.

NEW DELHI: Uncle Sam expects visitors from India to continue growing at the fastest rate till the end of this decade — as it has seen happen post Covid. The US government's National Travel and Tourism Office (NTTO) has forecast visitors from India will more than double at 201% from 2019’s 14.7 lakh in 2029, as against an average of 122% for rest of the world with Italy being the second fastest at 131%. Overall, international visitors to America are expected to increase to almost 10 crore in 2029, up from the 2019 figure of 7.9 crore.The US has so far seen visitors from only two countries surpass pre-pandemic levels — India and Italy. “Helped by a strong economy, visitation from India has increased 552% since 2020 to 22 lakh in 2024 and India has become the fourth largest US inbound travel market. This strong growth will continue over the next few years. India visitation is expected to be more than double that of the 2019 level by 2029,” a NTTO document says.Going ahead, the NTTO forecasts India to see the highest growth over 2019 visitors. “For India, one of the fastest growing countries since the pandemic, arrivals to the United States already exceeded the pre-pandemic level by almost 50% in 2024. Although visitation from all Asian countries included in the forecast increased significantly in 2024, China and Japan were still roughly halfway back to their pre-pandemic levels. At the same time, arrivals from South Korea reached three quarters of its 2019 level,” the document says.The NTTO forecast covers the top inbound markets for the US that include Canada, Mexico, France, Germany, Italy, UK, China, India, Japan, South Korea, Australia, and Brazil. Visitation from these countries accounted for 78% of total US international inbound arrivals in 2024. The US has classified these top markets under three heads: Those which surpassed pre-pandemic levels in 2024 (India and Italy); those that will do so in 2026 (Germany, France, Canada, Brazil, and Mexico) and those that will be fully recovered in 2027 and later (Australia, China, South Korea, UK and Japan).While India-US travel is rouching new highs post Covid, the travel industry says it remains way below potential due to two factors — long visa interview wait times and few direct flights due to US airlines not using Russian airspace. A record number of Indians travelled to the US last calendar year, more than CY 2023’s figure of 17.6 lakh which had overtaken the pre-Covid 2019 high of 14.7 lakh. India is now the second largest overseas source market of international visitors to the US, after the UK.The waiting period for B1/B2 interview is currently 407 days in Chennai; 156 in Delhi; 151 in Mumbai; 140 in Hyderabad and 114 in Kolkata, according to the US state department website.","The US has so far seen visitors from only two countries surpass pre-pandemic levels — India and Italy.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

Seven trillion USD economy size by 2030 is possible if India maintains its present growth trajectory, and in that journey startup entrepreneurs are going to play an important role,"" he is quoted as having said in the release.He was of the view that the active participation of startups in India in developing business models on the foundation of expanding physical and digital infrastructure will continue to generate efficiency, revenue and economic returns for the country.""The last decade has seen an exceptional transformation in the startup landscape in India, which has emerged as the third largest ecosystem globally, with over 1.12 lakh startups presently recognised by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) across 763 districts.""Among them, more than 110 are unicorns with a total valuation of around USD 350 billion,"" he said.The CEA further said that the country ranks second in innovation quality.He said that innovation in India was not just limited to certain sectors as startups were solving problems in 56 industrial sectors, with 13 per cent of them from IT services, nine per cent from health and life sciences, seven per cent from education, five per cent from agriculture and five per cent from food and beverages.Nageswaran also said it was significant that 49 per cent of the startups were from tier-2 and 3 cities which have turned to be game-changers as the business advantages in these locations enable entrepreneurs to operate at lower costs as compared to tier-1 cities.""Apart from improved infrastructure and the government's pro-active policies, the availability of a technically skilled talent pool is a huge advantage for startups to set up and flourish in tier-2 and tier-3 cities,"" he said.He said that historically there was a perception that small towns were difficult places to conduct business.""...but with improved internet penetration, vastly better physical infrastructure, road, rail and air connectivity and supportive government policies, this is no longer true,"" he said.He also noted Kerala's startup journey has been an inspiring one.The CEA said that KSUM has served as the catalyst since its establishment in 2006 to promote change that propelled the state into the forefront of the global startup arena.KSUM is the Kerala government's nodal agency established in 2006 for entrepreneurship development and incubation activities in the state.Nageswaran said that with over 4,000 registered tech startups, 63 incubators and 10 lakh square feet of incubation space, KSUM has not only met its goal of promoting technology-based entrepreneurship but has also earned the distinguished position of being among the world's top business incubators.The November 16-18 fifth edition of Huddle Global, India's biggest beachside startup conclave, was organised by KSUM at Adimalathura beach, near Vizhinjam, here.Attended by around 1,500 delegates, the event displayed sophisticated products from emerging sectors such as robotics, Artificial Intelligence , Machine Learning, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, life sciences, space tech, blockchain, IoT, e-governance, fintech, healthtech, agritech, edutech and SaaS from across the country.","Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran said tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country.

E-Commerce startup Udaan to trim costs ahead of 2025 IPO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/e-commerce-startup-udaan-to-trim-costs-ahead-of-2025-ipo/articleshow/105001132.cms,"E-commerce startup Udaan is working to curb costs and forge new partnerships with consumer brands in India as it prepares to go public in 2025.Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta said in an interview. That’s set to happen around the same time as its initial public offering, he said.The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said. “Second, strategically we want to ensure that we are top of mind with shopkeepers, with big manufacturers, and we maintain our relative market share.”Lightspeed Venture Partners-backed Udaan is among startups trying to tap the rapid growth of India’s economy and consumer market, while meeting investor demands for profitability. Udaan, which at its peak employed thousands, joined fellow Indian startups in slashing jobs last year and tightening internal controls and compliance. It now has about 1,800 staff, and Gupta didn’t specify if further job cuts are needed.Corporate governance lapses at Indian online tutoring firm Byju’s, once the country’s top startup with a valuation of $22 billion, shone a light at unique challenges faced by founders in the South Asian nation and drove companies to be more diligent.“We continue to move towards more professionalized management, professionalized board and also institutionalized shareholders as we go towards public markets,” Gupta said.Udaan is yet to decide whether it will list in India or overseas. It was valued at more than $3 billion in a 2021 funding round, and was in talks to raise $400 million, Business Standard reported in September. Lightspeed owns about 35% of Udaan, while Tencent Holdings Ltd. holds 6%.The company was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran Udaan until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021. The other two founders — Amod Malviya and Sujeet Kumar — are board members.Udaan built an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business still accounts for a very small part of India’s overall retail market but can balloon to $150 billion in sales and yield a 100% return on capital invested in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co. estimates published in the Mint newspaper.Bengaluru-based Udaan has also ventured into financing through its fintech unit which helps shopkeepers get working capital loans to buy inventory. That business is profitable before taxes and is growing 70% annually, Gupta said.“That’s a second business in the overall umbrella of Udaan trying to organize trade in the country,” Gupta said. “In addition to commerce, financing becomes an important market opportunity.”","Udaan will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta says.
