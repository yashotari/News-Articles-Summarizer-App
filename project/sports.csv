IPL 2025: How will KKR, MI, CSK, SRH, RCB fare this season?

TimesofIndia.com in Chennai: Suryakumar Yadav was all relaxed, had a nice laugh when MS Dhoni was referred to as an ""uncapped player"" and looked upbeat for the upcoming season of the Indian Premier League (IPL). This edition carries an additional layer of significance for Surya who hasn't had the best of times with the bat since taking over T20I captaincy from Rohit Sharma after the World Cup last year. India operated without fear and have had a splendid run under new head coach Gautam Gambhir in the bilaterals which followed but the spunk has been missing from Surya's blade.Fifteen outings as a captain have yielded a meagre 258 runs and struggles continued in the domestic circuit for Mumbai too. The bat which once breathed fire has been ice cool for a very long time and the IPL presents an opportunity to get back amongst the runs. The right-hander enjoyed a lot of success at No. 3 but has himself pushed down the order to accommodate Tilak Varma who has been in red hot form. While the move paid rich dividends for the young left-hander, Surya's batting stock has been on a bear run since then.With the Mumbai Indians , he will be free from captaincy duties, except the first game where he is leading because of Hardik Pandya's slow-over rate suspension, and would look to rediscover the mojo in the next few weeks. When asked about the return to No.3 spot, Surya kept cards close to his chest and asserted he is flexible to bat anywhere in the batting order.""It's always good to have that impact at the top. And I have seen that guy (Tilak), he has been working really hard. So for Team India, I thought it would be better if he can bat at number 3 and I can take the responsibility at number 4. Because for me, I think batting number doesn't matter. I will try and bat the same way, try and make that impact whenever there is an opportunity. And so does he. So you might see guys being flexible during this season, during this stint with the IPL. And everyone is flexible. Even I can bat at 3... I can bat at 5, Tilak can bat at 5. So it's that flexibility we have in our team,"" said Surya at the pre-match presser in Chennai.The 34-year-old continues to work hard in the nets and is hoping luck remains on his side during the cash-rich league. Clear mindset has always been the key and the right-hander wants to find that ""sweet spot"" consistently this season.""With the form, I think the harder you work, the luckier you get. If it has to come, it will come anytime. But I am actually a process-oriented man. I love to work hard in the nets. And if the runs have to follow, it will follow quickly. I love to follow a good process, good routine when I am there during practice sessions. If I am practicing well, hitting the ball really well in the nets. When I go into the game, if my mind is clear, I know what I have to do. That is the moment, that is the sweet spot for me. When I know that I am in good space and I will get runs for the side,"" explained Surya.Mumbai Indians get their campaign underway on Sunday and the focus will remain on Surya, and his returns with the bat, as the Indian cricket team has a heavy T20I calendar before the T20 World Cup next year and the last thing the side would want is the skipper's extended lean patch with the bat.He will have his ""eyes wide open"" keeping track of his India teammates but the extra significance the season carries will certainly be a test of Mr 360's character.",Suryakumar Yadav has struggled with the bat since taking over T20I captaincy from Rohit Sharma after the World Cup last year. The right-hander enjoyed a lot of success at No. 3 but has himself pushed down the order to accommodate Tilak Varma. The 34-year-old continues to work hard in the nets and is hoping luck remains on his side.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-119363374,imgsize-176530,width-400,resizemode-4/119363374.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) started their IPL 2025 campaign with a bang, securing a convincing seven-wicket win over defending champions Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) at the iconic Eden Gardens on Saturday. Led by new skipper Rajat Patidar, RCB showcased their dominance with both bat and ball to kick off their season in style.Chasing a competitive target of 175, RCB's dynamic opening pair of Phil Salt and Virat Kohli stole the show. The duo put on a blistering 95-run stand in just 8.3 overs, setting the foundation for an easy chase. Salt was the aggressor, hammering 56 off 31 balls with nine fours and two sixes. Kohli, the ""chase master,"" remained unbeaten on 59 off 36 deliveries, guiding RCB to 177/3 in 16.2 overs. Though KKR managed to pick up a few wickets, the damage had already been done, with Liam Livingstone sealing the victory with a boundary.The turning point of the match, however, came in the first innings when Krunal Pandya produced a remarkable spell to restrict KKR. At one stage, KKR seemed destined for a massive total, reaching 107/1 after 10 overs, with Ajinkya Rahane (56) and Sunil Narine (44) smashing the RCB bowlers. However, Krunal’s three-wicket burst in quick succession changed the game. He dismissed Rahane, Venkatesh Iyer (6), and Rinku Singh (12), sending shockwaves through the KKR camp and halting their momentum.Rahane fell trying to clear the boundary but found the fielder at deep backward square leg. Soon after, Venkatesh Iyer and Rinku Singh fell prey to Krunal’s sharp turn and clean bowled by the RCB spinner. The once-promising innings collapsed from 107/1 to 145/5 within just a few overs. KKR never recovered, eventually posting 174/8 in their 20 overs.Josh Hazlewood complemented Krunal's efforts, claiming two wickets for 22 runs, including the key scalp of Quinton de Kock in the opening over. Rasikh Salam, Yash Dayal and Suyash Sharma chipped in with a wicket each.Despite the valiant efforts of Rahane and Narine, KKR’s middle order faltered under pressure, unable to capitalise on the strong start. The combination of Krunal’s decisive spell and RCB’s ruthless batting performance made the difference, ensuring a commanding victory for the visitors.","Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) beat Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) by seven wickets.

Their fast-paced approach made the chase look easy, with RCB reaching the target in just 16.2 overs with 177/3 on the board.Kohli’s composure and ability to adapt to the situation was evident, as he played with calm authority, seeing his side through the chase with crucial boundaries and sixes.Earlier in the match, KKR had set a competitive target, finishing their innings at 174/8. Ajinkya Rahane played a key role with 56 runs, and Sunil Narine provided valuable support with a quickfire 44 off 26 balls.However, RCB’s bowlers, led by Krunal Pandya (3/29) and Josh Hazlewood (2/22), executed a well-structured comeback after KKR’s solid start.Their combined efforts restricted KKR from accelerating in the death overs, leaving them with a target that was always within reach for RCB.As RCB have made a strong start to IPL 2025, Kohli’s contribution on and off the field remains invaluable.","Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) beat Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) by seven wickets in IPL 2025 season opener.

KOLKATA: Another season in the sultry Indian summer. Another round of a cocktail of cricket and entertainment, with its unique spicy garnish. Another edition of the Indian Premier League (IPL), which has redefined the game in less than two decades of its existence. Even as its original founder Lalit Modi grapples with uncertainties over his nationality, the IPL has firmly shown that it is here to stay.On Saturday, the T20 tournament starts yet another two-month journey of breathless excitement. Plenty of runs, cheerleaders dancing to blaring music, some nail-biting late finishes, maybe some rain. Defending champions Kolkata Knight Riders take on perennial pretenders Royal Challengers Bengaluru in the opening match at the Eden Gardens, with the inaugural ceremony peppered with some Bollywood-style frolic, weather permitting.Shreya Ghoshal, Karan Aujla and Disha Patani are among the entertainers to have been lined up for the gala event. ‘Host of honour’ Shah Rukh Khan could well shake a leg or two. The possibility of rain and thunderstorm has been a mood dampener. Fingers crossed.Battles within the battle have always been the top draw in the IPL evening (and a few matinee) shows. How about a Virat Kohli vs Varun Chakravarthy for starters? As much as the teams, the IPL is also about individuals.Loyalties change with the colour of the jersey. In the blink of an eye, forever friends become foes on the field. Take Phil Salt, for example. The Englishman was so crucial in KKR’s triumph last year. He will be there in Saturday’s opening show, but in the rival camp. Ask him how he feels coming up against Harshit Rana, and he’ll have mixed feelings.Fellow Englishman Jos Buttler was surprised when Rajasthan Royals let him go, even penning a heartfelt farewell to the Jaipur franchise. Clearly, emotions have no place in the IPL auction, where only practical logic works. Buttler now has an opportunity to showcase his power for Gujarat Titans.And Kohli has another chance to grab the trophy missing from his cabinet even after 17 years of toil. With questions on his longevity abound, age doesn’t seem to have dimmed his enthusiasm. Eyeballs will still follow him wherever he plays: Those animated celebrations; those death stares. Although Kohli will be playing under Rajat Patidar, the India star in all likelihood, will have a major say in decision making.Patidar, incidentally, made his IPL debut in 2021, by which time Kohli had already played 192 matches. Ditto for Chennai Super Kings where Mahendra Singh Dhoni, one of the shrewdest cricketing brains, could be the guiding light for Ruturaj Gaikwad.KL Rahul and Faf du Plessis would assist skipper Axar Patel in the leadership troika at Delhi Capitals. Mumbai Indians have both the current India skippers, but none of them will lead the team.Hardik Pandya will draw on Rohit Sharma and Suryakumar Yadav’s acumen. The last mentioned will stand in for Pandya in their opener.Decision making could also be a split operation in KKR, who will be out to defend their title without Gautam Gambhir’s Midas Touch. Ajinkya Rahane’s leadership qualities are well documented, but Venkatest Iyer, heir apparent to the throne, could well be tested for that role with a match or two.Even Rajasthan Royals’s Riyan Parag will be put on captaincy perch in their first three matches. Two of those games in his hometown, Guwahati, a clear indications that the franchise is looking at him as a long-term prospect.Talking about Royals, it will be interesting to see how Vaibhav Suryavanshi, who will turn 14 next Thursday, shapes up. Of course the question remains whether the hard-hitting batter from Bihar will get to play a game.Hitting hard is the launchpad on which T20 innings are built and one team capable of it is Sunrisers Hyderabad. The Heinrich Klaasens, Travis Heads, Abhishek Sharmas love the pitches in India and are quite capable of erecting skyscrapers. However, slam-bang batters are spread out evenly, like Jake Fraser-McGurk (DC), Shashank Singh (PBSK), Rishabh Pant (LSG), Devon Con -way (CSK), Sunil Narine (KKR)...the list just goes on.Let’s spare a thought for the bowlers too, who often go into an IPL contest with the head coach telling them, “don’t be afraid of getting hit”.It won’t be easy to hit KKR spinner Chakravarthy though, whose mystical magic has mesmerised many a batter. Rashid Khan, Ravindra Jadeja, Yuzvendra Chahal have repeatedly reminded that spinners play a big role too. However, it will be pacers like Jasprit Bumrah (when he is fit), Mohammed Shami, Mitchell Starc, Jofra Archer and Arshdeep Singh whose opening and closing statements could be the difference between victory and defeat.","Defending champions Kolkata Knight Riders take on Royal Challengers Bengaluru in the opening match at the Eden Gardens.

RCB in IPL 2025: Royal Challengers Bengaluru chase maiden title

Team India batter Virat Kohli is well known for his confidence and desire to dominate the best bowlers in the business, smashing runs fearlessly even when other batters around him struggle to score. Kohli showcased the same passion and hunger to excel while facing former South Africa pacer and current Team India bowling coach Morne Morkel , during an IPL 2015 match against Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR).""Kohli was watching Morkel bowl during a practice session held before the match. The deliveries were bouncing massively. Kohli said, 'I will smash Morkel for fours and sixes tomorrow to all parts of the ground'. He seemed pretty confident of a solid knock despite the bounce being generated,"" said former Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) batter Manvinder Bisla during an exclusive interaction with TimesofIndia.com.""Kohli started off confidently against KKR but eventually got dismissed for 13 by Morkel, following a catch down leg by Robin Uthappa. Usually, most players are down on confidence after being dismissed and doubt themselves but Kohli's reaction was quite interesting in this situation. While walking back, Kohli kept telling himself, 'Today, he got lucky otherwise I would have definitely smashed him for many sixes and scored a half-century at least. I am going to smash Morkel for a lot of runs the next time I face him',"" added Bisla.The former RCB and KKR batter also shared an anecdote from an IPL 2011 match between KKR and Mumbai Indians (MI), where former Indian pacer Lakshmipathy Balaji failed to defend 21 runs off the last over. Ambati Rayudu smashed a six off the last ball of the match, resulting in MI pulling off a thrilling win.""KKR head coach Dav Whatmore was absolutely furious in the dressing room after the match. However, KKR captain Gautam Gambhir came, put his arm around Balaji's shoulder and said, 'Nobody will say anything to him. We are all collectively responsible for this',"" stated Bisla.",Virat Kohli is well known for his confidence and desire to dominate the best bowlers in the business.

Argentina moved closer to securing their spot in the 2026 World Cup after defeating Uruguay 1-0 in Montevideo on Friday, thanks to a brilliant goal from Thiago Almada.The match appeared to be heading towards a draw against Uruguay, who had previously defeated Argentina 2-0 in Buenos Aires during the qualifying rounds.The decisive moment came when Almada, the 23-year-old attacking midfielder, received the ball on the edge of the area and unleashed a powerful shot into the top corner, beyond Uruguay goalkeeper Sergio Rochet's reach.Argentina's otherwise strong performance was slightly marred in stoppage time when Nicolas Gonzalez received a red card for a dangerous high boot challenge on Uruguay's Nahitan Nandez.Argentina coach Lionel Scaloni expressed satisfaction with his team's performance, particularly in Messi's absence due to injury.""How can I not be satisfied? Not just for the result -- but for how they gave it their all. The satisfaction comes from the fact that the team played a complete match. When one player is missing, another comes in (...) we have enough to go out onto the field calmly, but the team is there.""Argentina can become the first South American team to qualify for the 2026 World Cup in the United States, Canada and Mexico if they defeat Brazil in Buenos Aires on Tuesday.Argentina currently leads the South American qualifying group with 28 points from 13 games, followed by Ecuador in second place with 22 points and Brazil in third with 21 points.Uruguay holds fourth position with 20 points from 13 matches, just ahead of Paraguay on goal difference.The victory guarantees Argentina at least a seventh-place finish, ensuring them a minimum of an inter-confederation playoff spot, with the top six teams qualifying directly for the World Cup.In another South American qualifier, Ecuador strengthened their qualification chances by defeating Venezuela 2-1, with veteran striker Enner Valencia scoring both goals.Ecuador is pursuing their fifth World Cup appearance in the nation's history.Ecuador's coach Sebastian Beccacece commented on the team's performance while emphasizing the importance of staying focused.""When things are going well, like today when we've won three games in a row, we have to be cautious, calm, humble, and have a lot of discipline to continue growing in what's coming up.""","Argentina defeated Uruguay 1-0 in Montevideo on Friday.

As per our records, there is no violation.”The AIFF swung into action after being informed by FIFA that the dispute between NorthEast and Blasters was of a “national dimension, the eligibility of a player in a competition falling under the auspices of AIFF.”","Kerala Blasters cannot be punished for fielding Dusan Lagator, who had a pending suspension at the time of his transfer from Hungarian club Debreceni VSC to India.

PANAJI: Hamza Choudhury ’s arrival in Bangladesh earlier this week, sparked a never-before frenzy for a footballer in south Asia. The midfielder’s car was mobbed by supporters, everyone wanted a piece of him, a touch, a selfie, good enough even if he caught the eye. And there was so much Hamza had to do, including, among other things, a meeting with the adviser for Youth and Sports to the Interim Government.All this, before the team left for India for the opening group clash of the Asian Cup 2027 final round qualifiers on Thursday.Hamza, 27, you could say, is no ordinary footballer. No Lionel Messi, but with 57 Premier League appearances for Leicester City until Januay this year, he’s the highest profile footballer to represent a south Asian country in internationals.Until his loan move to Championship side Sheffield United in January, the Foxes academy graduate was the only British Asian playing in the Premier League in over two decades. Zesh Rehman, of Pakistani origin, was the first British Asian to start a Premier League match, turning out for Fulham in 2003.The Birmingham-born Rehman chose to represent hosts Pakistan at the 2005 SAFF Championship — a tournament where incidentally, a 20-year-old striker called Sunil Chhetri made his international debut for India.Rehman went on to make 22 appearances for the Pakistan national team, even captaining the side. On Thursday it was a similar feeling towards the east of the region.“It feels like our Messi is here,” Bangladesh captain Jamal Bhuyan told reporters during the team’s official media briefing prior to Thursday’s departure. “The excitement is five times greater than when I first arrived. Hamza is a Premier League player, it’s a huge boost for us,” added Bhuyan.Bhuyan’s own story is equally fascinating. After showing promise as a junior in Denmark, he was on the verge of breaking into the senior team when he was caught in the crossfire of gang-related gunfire in the Danish capital, a bullet hitting his head and putting him into coma.His career slowed down, and in 2013, he eventually returned to Bangladesh. Five years later, he rose to become captain. Hamza is even more special. Born to a Grenadian father and a Bangladeshi mother, Hamza made seven appearances for England Under-21s and chose to represent Bangladesh in senior international football , thanks to his ancestry. The defensive midfielder is expected to make his international debut against India in Shillong on Tuesday.India go into the fixture on the back of a 3-0 friendly win against the Maldives on Wednesday. There were two goals from set-pieces; Rahul Bheke scored in his second successive game, Liston Colaco scored his first in India colours, but more importantly, Sunil Chhetri, coaxed out of retirement at 40 by coach Manolo Marquez, showed just why he can still be counted to deliver.For Bangladesh, who would have been watching closely, it’s Hamza who they are counting upon.“You can’t compare Sunil Chhetri to Hamza. Sunil has done great things for India, but let’s be honest, Hamza is a Premier League player,” said Bhuyan, the poster boy of Bangladesh football, until Hamza’s arrival.At 185th, Bangladesh is the lowest-ranked team in the Asian Cup 2027 qualifiers group, which also has Hong Kong and Singapore. But Hamza’s inclusion has raised hopes of qualification to the continental showpiece for the first time.“One player cannot fully change one team, but it’s true that Hamza’s inclusion has raised expectations around the national team,” former Bangladesh national team coach Oscar Bruzon told TOI.Now with East Bengal, Bruzon spoke of the edge Hamza’s presence adds.“When you have a player from the Premier League, the standards rise and the players around you are motivated to do their best. The advantage for Bangladesh is more psychological,” he said.Bruzon is no stranger to football in Bangladesh. In the five years that he spent there, he won the Bangladesh Premier League four times with Basundhara Kings and, in addition to his club duties, took charge of the national team.“Bangladesh has strong players (physically), but they are missing a little bit of creativity in the middle. Hamza can play centre-back or defensive midfield, but I think they will try and bring him forward (more). There will be changes in some patterns of play. He is definitely of a different level, so everyone will have to adapt and adjust on the pitch.“Hamza will be very motivated,” pointed out Bruzon. “The craze is un - believable. I don’t think adaptation will be difficult because Bangladesh already has some technically good players. Tariq Kazi (Finland), for example, is young and talented defender. They are looking for others too playing in higher leagues.”","Hamza Choudhury is the highest profile footballer to represent a south Asian country in internationals.

SHILLONG: Despite the first win in 2025, and one after 489 days, all is not well in the Indian camp.Late on Wednesday, Manolo Marquez was a worried man even after securing his first win after becoming India coach in July. Unable to pick the injured Lallianzuala Chhangte and Asish Rai for this FIFA window, Marquez will now miss winger Manvir Singh and midfielder Brandon Fernandes for the crucial AFC Asian Cup qualifier against Bangladesh here on Tuesday.While Manvir — in fine form for 2024-25 ISL Shield Winners Mohun Bagan Super Giant — was released from the squad ahead of the Maldives friendly that India won 3-0, Marquez said Brandon, too, is certain to miss the Bangladesh tie.“Brandon won’t be available, for sure. It’s really bad luck that we lost three players — in the last game of the ISL, Manvir on Tuesday during the break session and today Brandon,” he said after the game on Wednesday.One of the more influential players against Maldives till he was stretchered off from the ground in the 39th minute, Brandon also delivered the corner for Rahul Bheke’s opening goal on Wednesday.The Mumbai City attacking midfielder went down to the ground in great pain at the half-hour mark, before being able to carry on for only another 10 minutes. Marquez did not want to take any risk, and had Brandon substituted with Chennaiyin FC striker-winger Farukh Choudhary.The player was later seen with a heavily strapped knee.Brandon’s unavailability forces the coach now on finding an able replacement ahead of Tuesday’s competitive clash.“We will call someone. We will recover Brison, who was in the stands, but let’s see which player,” he said.Brison Fernandes, who had a fine season at FC Goa under Marquez himself, missed the Maldives tie with a minor injury. Marquez did not want to risk aggravating the niggle, but with Brandon out, he could step in after regaining match fitness in in the interim week.A contender for the ISL Emerging Player Award, the 23-year-old midfielder has seven goals and two assists in 22 appearances this season. With passing accuracy and a fine possession game, Brison has the ingredients to graduate into an asset under Marquez.Aiming for their third consecutive appearance in the Asian meet, India are clubbed with Hong Kong China, Singapore and Bangladesh in Group C of the qualifiers.

- 'Not to mock him' -

COPENHAGEN: Rasmus Hojlund earned Denmark a deserved 1-0 lead over Portugal in their Nations League quarter-final first leg clash on Thursday. The Manchester United forward delivered from the bench to split the teams in Copenhagen, providing the finishing touch Denmark previously lacked on a night where they dominated Roberto Martinez's side.The Spanish coach selected veteran Cristiano Ronaldo , 40, up front but the Al-Nassr striker was mostly frozen out of the game.Winners of the inaugural tournament in 2019, Portugal are aiming to become the first team to lift the Nations League trophy for a second time.However they will need to improve swiftly to reach the semi-finals as Denmark outclassed them and could have scored more on the night, with Christian Eriksen missing a penalty.""It was our worst performance in the last two years,"" Portugal coach Martinez admitted, speaking to RTP.""After a five-month break, we clearly didn't come out with the intensity we needed. Denmark's pressure was very effective.""We lacked a lot. We lacked intensity... the level of our performance is not at the level we expected.""Looking for their first win under coach Brian Riemer, who was appointed in October, the Danes were without injured captain Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg.Denmark piled on the pressure from the start, with debutant Mika Biereth charging down Diogo Costa's clearance, but the goalkeeper managed to escape with conceding only a corner.Jesper Lindstrom forced Costa into action again with an effort from distance, while Pedro Neto tested Kasper Schmeichel at the other end.The hosts won a penalty when Portugal defender Renato Veiga handled the ball but Costa produced a superb save to deny Eriksen.The Porto goalkeeper, an expert in saving spot kicks, dived low to his right to thwart the Manchester United midfielder.Costa made another stunning save from Biereth to keep his team level, as Denmark turned the screw.When the hosts finally beat Costa, Diogo Dalot was in the right place at the right time to clear Eriksen's effort off the line just before the break, after good work by Gustav Isaksen.Riemer's side stayed on top in the second half, with Costa saving an Eriksen free-kick, although Vitinha came close for Portugal, who showed occasional flashes of their quality on an otherwise lethargic display.Isaksen, a constant menace, had a shot deflected behind as Denmark started to fear their dominance would not translate into a lead. However Hojlund, on as a substitute, had other ideas.The striker, who ended a long Manchester United drought last weekend by scoring in his team's win at Leicester City, broke the deadlock by slotting home to cap a fine move.Eriksen spread the ball to another substitute, Andreas Skov Olsen, who picked out Hojlund with a low ball to finish coolly in the 78th minute.The forward imitated Ronaldo's jumping ""Siuuu"" celebration but said it was a tribute to the former Man United and Real Madrid superstar.""I'm playing against the world's best footballer, my idol, and to score and become the (match) winner, it couldn't be better,"" Hojlund told Denmark's TV2.""It was not to mock him or anything, I've always said he has had great importance for me and my football career.""Portugal's Bernardo Silva, making his 99th appearance for his country, had a penalty appeal late on waved away after falling under pressure from Patrick Dorgu in the box, and Schmeichel saved from Neto in the final stages.Portugal host Denmark in the second leg in Lisbon on Sunday.""Pressure is part of football, now it increases because we're one goal down, but we have time to correct that,"" Costa told RTP.""Everything is still up for grabs and we have to focus on that to give a reaction (to this defeat).""",Denmark beat Portugal 1-0 in their Nations League quarter-final first leg clash.

SHILLONG: Sunil Chhetri justified being coaxed out of his international retirement by a beleaguered India coach Manolo Marquez with a performance on his return to the national fold, which seemed like he had never left at all. That, and a fine glancing header for his 95th career goal helped give India its first international win in over a year — after 489 days — a 3-0 scoreline against Maldives here on Wednesday.Chhetri who started the game and stayed in the thick of things till he was substituted in the 82nd minute, helped himself to a goal in the 76th. Before that, Rahul Bheke (34) and Liston Colaco (66) had done enough to put the issue beyond Maldives’s reach.Marquez got his first win as India head coach and India got their first victory after over a year. They were winless in their last five international games with two of those being losses.For the first half hour, however, both sides looked to be playing a friendly game without fire as the play lacked any quality moves at both ends of the pitch. Once Bheke scored the opener with a header from Brandon Fernandes corner from left, the complexion of the match changed for the better for the home side.Despite the pre-game craze, the official attendance for India’s first ever international game in Shillong was a modest 6,798. On the lukewarm response, the Meghalaya Football Association (MFA) said it being a weekday as well as a friendly could be they reason for low turnout.They were optimistic it would be a full house when Bangladesh come calling Tuesday. Still, there was enough support for Chhetri, the crowd screaming his name, and he didn’t disappoint.The first half ended with India keeping their nose ahead with the sole lead. Five minutes after the change of ends, India found themselves with a brilliant chance to double their lead, only to be denied off the goalline by the Maldives defence.In the 66th minute, Maldives goalkeeper Hussain Shareef forced an excellent save with his leg, but the resultant corner produced the goal India were looking for. This time Naorem Mahesh Singh curled his corner from left towards the second post where an unmarked Colaco rose to the occasion to double the advantage and broke into a Cristiano Ronaldo-like celebration near the corner flag.But the stand erupted in joy only when Chhetri brought in his 95th strike towards the end on his international return as he flicked a header following Colaco’s assist.Maldives barely entered the Indian territory throughout the match.",India beat Maldives 3-0 in their first international game in over a year. Sunil Chhetri scored his 95th goal for the national team. Rahul Bheke and Liston Colaco also scored for India.

NEW DELHI: Sunil Chhetri made a remarkable comeback to the national team after retiring from international football in May last year. In a friendly match against Maldives on Wednesday, Chhetri's presence proved to be the catalyst for India's commanding 3-0 victory, helping the team snap their 12-match winless streak that had persisted since November 2023.The match unfolded with Rahul Bheke giving India the lead in the 35th minute, followed by Liston Colaco extending the advantage to 2-0 in the 66th minute.The 40-year-old Chhetri, who had returned to the national team, etched his name in the scoresheet with a glancing header in the 77th minute, marking his 95th international goal .Chhetri's impact was evident as he narrowly missed a scoring opportunity in the 47th minute, denied by the Maldives goalkeeper. He was eventually substituted in the 82nd minute, having made a memorable contribution to the team's victory.This triumph held significance as it marked India's first win in 16 months and the first under the guidance of Manolo Marquez , who was appointed as the head coach in July last year. India's previous victory came against Kuwait (1-0) in their 2026 FIFA World Cup qualifying round match in Kuwait City on November 16, 2023.The friendly match served as a dress rehearsal for India's crucial AFC Asian Cup qualifier against Bangladesh, scheduled for March 25 at the same venue. Chhetri's return to the national team was specifically aimed at aiding the team's successful navigation through the qualifiers.With Maldives ranked 162nd in the world, 36 places below India (126th), the match provided an opportunity for the Indian team to regain their winning momentum and prepare for the upcoming challenges in the AFC Asian Cup qualifiers .",India beat Maldives 3-0 in a friendly match on Wednesday.

BENGALURU: Vedant Mohan -- India’s most promising sub-junior tennis player (under-14) – has kickstarted the next step of his junior career, transitioning to the International Tennis Federation’s junior Tour (under-18).The 14-year-old, who had been locked down at his training base in Javea, a coastal town in Spain since February, started by playing a couple of base-level ITFs in Sri Lanka these last weeks. He's scheduled for more J30s and J60s in May, most likely in Africa.Vedant, left-handed, also plays on the Spanish circuit and has gained immensely in the last few years competing in Tennis Europe events alongside some of the best under-14 talents in the world. Vedant’s highest ranking in the under-14 section of the Tennis Europe ratings was achieved on his 14th birthday this January, when he still had another 12 months left in the age-group.He was ranked No.13 and at the time, the only Asian in the top 25.While playing in Europe helped grow Vedant’s game, the 5-feet-8-inch Indian couldn’t play the full circuit. He didn’t qualify for the European Championships, the Summer or Winter Cups, all big-ticket competitions, and open only to Europeans as they are team events.That, along with the fact that he was cash-strapped, contributed to Vedant’s rather limited matchplay in comparison to his peers (2011-born) who were ranked higher than him.For instance, the TE No.1 (U-14) Mario Vukovic of France has played 176 singles matches and the No.2 Greece’s Rafael Pagonis played 192 while Vedant has played just 102.The 14-year-old will now play a mix of U-16 and U-18 tournaments in Spain, while targeting ITF under-18s. Vedant’s parents – father Dhruv and mother Anisha – moved to Spain five years ago when their son, then nine, received a tennis scholarship.Mohan, a commercial pilot, has for most part funded Vedant’s mushrooming career, while also leaning on Anisha’s and his family back home in India. He lives in Muscat, while Anisha and their two sons live in Javea, where Vedant trains under Javier Ferrer, brother of former top-5 pro David.Vedant, who idolises tennis legend Novak Djokovic because of his mentality, says his favourite surface is clay.“I love that I can rip the ball hard and heavy with topspin on clay. Also, I love to slide,” he told TOI. “My favourite shot is my inside-out forehand. I like to play aggressively, my game is all court. I like to volley and also play with variation.”Mohan, a collegiate-level tennis player in India, winning gold medals in singles and doubles, is hoping his son will be part of junior Grand Slam draws in the next 18-to-24 months.“The ultimate goal is the pros, the ATP Tour,” he said, adding, “At this stage we’re only looking to develop his game.”","Vedant Mohan is India’s most promising sub-junior tennis player (under-14) The 14-year-old will now play a mix of U-16 and U-18 tournaments in Spain.

Miami:

Australian Nick Kyrgios won his first match since 2022 as he fought back from a set down to beat American Mackenzie McDonald 3-6, 6-3, 6-4 at the Miami Open on Wednesday.Kyrgios's career has been blighted by injuries in the last two years and he had to retire from his first round match at Indian Wells earlier this month.The flamboyant 29-year-old had suffered pain in his surgically reconstructed right wrist - a procedure that left him on the sidelines for 18 months.""It has been a long journey, even to just get to the start line of matches and be scared to just finish them,"" Kyrgios said.""To come off and get a win and feel like I belong again was special,"" added after the one-hour, 43-minute victory.Kyrgios, the 2022 Wimbledon finalist, has been plagued by injuries in his career but it was the wrist which caused him the most serious issues and he said he was deeply pessimistic about his chances of a comeback.""I never thought I would play tennis again to be brutally honest with you. I was having conversations with my camp and my team, and I said 'I don't know how long I can keep doing this for',"" he said.""This (win) puts some petrol in the tank but I need to be realistic and see how my wrist feels tomorrow because it is a grind out here,"" he added.There was a first round win for 38-year-old Frenchman Gael Monfils who became the second oldest man, after Jimmy Connors, to win at the Miami Open.Monfils beat last year's quarter-finalist, Hungary's Fabian Marozsan, 6-3, 3-6, 6-4.In the women's draw, Emma Raducanu claimed her first win, defeating 19-year-old wild card Sayaka Ishii of Japan 6-2, 6-1 in just 65 minutes.The 2021 US Open champion will face eighth-seeded American Emma Navarro in the second round, her first meeting with a top 10 player since losing to Iga Swiatek in the Australian Open third round.""It's going to be an extremely challenging match,"" Raducanu said in her on-court interview.

I felt like I was in control. I knew what I needed to do. I just went for it and played to win.""In his first Masters 1000 final, Draper established control early, taking a 4-0 lead. He lost only four points on serve in the opening set, while Rune committed 10 of his 19 unforced errors.Rune, who had previously won the Paris Masters in 2022, managed to hold serve twice before losing the first set. The set concluded with Draper's ace, followed by Rune's backhand error.""I think today was very clear that I didn't play well enough. He was serving amazing, for sure.

The British player, ranked 14th globally, secured a 6-1, 0-6, 6-4 victory over Alcaraz to advance to his first Masters 1000 final .Denmark's Rune, ranked 13th, defeated world number six Daniil Medvedev in straight sets 7-5, 6-4. Medvedev had finished as runner-up to Alcaraz in the previous two years.""This one hurts. I don't want to lose any match, but I think this one was even more special to me. It was difficult today, a lot of nerves in the match.""Draper ended Alcaraz's 16-match winning streak at Indian Wells. He dominated the first set in 23 minutes as Alcaraz struggled against his left-handed serve.The second set saw a complete reversal as Alcaraz improved his game. After saving a break point with a 137 mph ace in the opening game, he broke Draper's serve three times to level the match.""It was a strange match in all honesty. Carlos came out a little flat, I sensed that. I had a chance in the first game of the second, and he came up with an ace... What happened to him happened to me, I got tight, I had low energy. I got lost out there for 25 minutes, but in the third, I was really proud of my competitiveness, my attitude and I somehow managed to get over the line.""In the third set, Draper broke Alcaraz for a 2-1 lead following a lengthy video review. The review confirmed Draper had successfully returned Alcaraz's drop shot before a double bounce.Umpire Mohamed Lahyani initially called for a replay but then awarded the point to Draper, ruling his ""not up"" call hadn't affected Alcaraz's play.""Waiting for the ball reviews, they didn't bother me at all. All I can say is Jack came, he played much better than me. That point didn't affect my play at all.""Draper secured another break for a 5-2 lead after Alcaraz failed to convert four game points.

BENGALURU: The first two months of the 2025 tennis season has been all uphill for Sumit Nagal , starting in Melbourne in January and then on clay in Rosario and Buenos Aires, laid low by a flu.The 27-year-old will make a return to tournament play in the ATP Challenger in Murcia next week after staying away from the Tour for about a month.Nagal, whose ranking is down to 132, was thrown a curveball by what he suspects was a bout of Covid-19 in January. The Indian, who chose the rigour of the South American swing over the four-week ATP Challenger series in India in February, was caught unawares in Argentina.“If I knew I was (so) unwell I would never have gone to South America,” Nagal told TOI during a telephone interview. “You’re going so far away, not feeling your best, that makes no sense.”Nagal, who has spent the last few weeks at his training base in Germany, is gradually working his way back.“I never really felt good since Australia, it was maybe Covid-19 over there, I wasn’t sure,” the India No.1 said. “When I was in Argentina I was practicing a bit and then I wasn’t really practicing. It wasn’t a great few weeks for me. I was struggling so much with my health, I was fatigued, I was barely practicing. And when I practiced or played I would feel super tired.”“It has been good in the last two weeks. I have been practicing quite a bit, pushing a bit,” said Nagal, who marked his fitness at eight on a scale of 1 to 10.Nagal, who climbed to a career-high No.68 in the ranking last July, is now chasing a main draw berth at Roland Garros. He’s scheduled to play two ATP Challengers, followed by Monte Carlo Masters 1000, where he went through qualifiers last year to make the round of 32, after which the Indian will look at 250 Series tournaments.While there are nine Indians in the top-150 of the doubles rankings, Nagal is the only Indian in the top-250 of the singles rankings on the men’s and women’s tours.","Sumit Nagal will make a return to tournament play in the ATP Challenger in Murcia next week.

Sabalenka trounces Keys in Australian Open re-match

Russian teenager Mirra Andreeva ended the defending champion Iga Swiatek 's quest for a historic third Indian Wells title, defeating the world number two 7-6 (1), 1-6, 6-3 on Friday to advance to the final.At just 17, Andreeva snapped Swiatek's 10-match winning streak at Indian Wells, marking her second victory over the Polish star in three weeks—having previously triumphed in Dubai's quarter-finals en route to becoming the youngest WTA 1000 champion ever.On Sunday, Andreeva will face Aryna Sabalenka , who dominated Australian Open champion Madison Keys . The American veteran Keys had denied Sabalenka a third consecutive title in Melbourne, where she claimed her first major in January.Andreeva is the youngest finalist at Indian Wells since Kim Clijsters, who was 17 in 2001.In the match against Swiatek, Andreeva showcased her skills in the first set tiebreaker and managed to regroup after a challenging second set.Although Swiatek started confidently, dropping only one point in her first three service games, Andreeva seized a 5-4 lead with a crucial break, benefiting from a double fault by Swiatek. The match proceeded to a tiebreaker where Andreeva dominated.""I felt like I'm gonna go and play the tiebreak like it's the last tiebreak of my life,"" she said. ""So I just went for all my shots. My serve was great. I just felt super comfortable and confident,"" she said.""I saw my mom's nervous face in the big screen,"" Andreeva told the crowd. ""I tried not to look there.""Despite Swiatek rebounding in the second set with three breaks, the momentum shifted back to Andreeva in the third. She ultimately secured victory with her third break of the set.""I just decided to kind of still play the same but maybe go for my shots more, trying to play a little bit more aggressive,"" she said.""I feel also that I was dealing with the nerves and the pressure pretty good, so I just feel proud of myself.""World number one Aryna Sabalenka dispatched Madison Keys 6-0, 6-1 to reach the Indian Wells final, avenging her loss to the fifth-ranked American in the Australian Open final.In just 51 minutes, Sabalenka set up a title match against Andreeva.The Belarusian, seeking revenge after her January defeat to Keys, was sharp from the start, completing the first set in just 23 minutes.""I was hungry,"" said Sabalenka, who had made no bones about wanting revenge. ""That Australian Open match was really heartbroken for me, and I really needed some time to recover after that.""And if I would lose today again, it would get in my head and I didn't want that to happen. I was really focused -- I was just really hungry to get this win against Madison.""Keys, who had a 16-match winning streak culminating in her Australian Open victory, struggled to make an impact.""I think tactically I played really great tennis,"" said Sabalenka, adding her strategy was to ""just keep her out of the rhythm"".Despite overcoming the cold, swirling winds on Stadium Court and winning the first 11 games, Sabalenka's dominance was clear. Keys managed to hold serve for the first time at 5-1 in the second set, but Sabalenka quickly closed out the match.This marks Sabalenka's second appearance in the Indian Wells final; she was the runner-up to Elena Rybakina in 2023.","Russian teenager Mirra Andreeva beat defending champion Iga Swiatek 7-6 (1), 1-6, 6-3. At 17, she is the youngest finalist at Indian Wells since Kim Clijsters in 2001. She will face Aryna Sabalenka, who beat Australian Open champion Madison Keys.

Madison Keys powered into the Indian Wells semifinals on Thursday, dismantling wild-card Belinda Bencic 6-1, 6-1 in just 65 minutes to notch her 16th straight victory. The fifth-seeded American, who claimed the Australian Open title earlier this year, now sets up a highly anticipated rematch with world No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka . The two last met at Melbourne Park in January, where Keys defeated Sabalenka in a three-set battle, halting the Belarusian’s bid for a third straight title.Despite upsetting No. 4 seed Coco Gauff in the previous round, Bencic — a 28-year-old from Switzerland — had no answers for Keys’ relentless play.Elsewhere in the women’s draw, defending champion Iga Swiatek continued her dominant run in the California desert, advancing to her fourth straight semifinal at Indian Wells with a 6-3, 6-3 win over eighth-seeded Qinwen Zheng. Swiatek, the No. 2 seed and a five-time Grand Slam winner, is aiming to become the first woman to win the event three times. She’s riding a 10-match win streak at Indian Wells, having also lifted the trophy in 2022.Zheng, who had ended Swiatek’s 25-match winning streak at the Paris Olympics last year, couldn’t replicate that magic. Though she broke Swiatek twice and won six games — equaling the total games Swiatek had lost all tournament — the Polish star converted all five of her break points to seal the match.In the men’s draw, two-time defending champion Carlos Alcaraz fought off determined challenger Francisco Cerundolo 6-3, 7-6 (7/4) to reach the semi-finals.On another cold, blustery night in the California desert, Alcaraz battled back from 1-4 down in the second set, coming up with a break and two love service holds to force the tiebreaker as he kept his bid to join Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic as the only men to win three straight Indian Wells titles on track.Alcaraz had to save break points in each of his first three service games. But after an emphatic hold for 4-3 he gained the first break of the contest with a deft volley and just like that he was serving for the first set.After sliding to pop a drop volley winner over the net for set point Alcaraz drilled a deep forehand that Cerundolo could barely get a racquet on.But it was Cerundolo who broke first in the second, finally converting his ninth break point of the match then holding for 4-1.But he couldn't hold off the world number three, who raced to a 5-2 lead in the tiebreaker on the way to victory.""It was really difficult for me to start the match,"" said Alcaraz, who looked less comfortable in the windy weather than he did just a day before.""He got a lot of chances in the first set,"" Alcaraz said. ""I'm just pleased about saving all of them and taking the only one that I had.""I didn't hit the ball as clear as yesterday, but I just did what I had to and that's what it's about.""Alcaraz next faces Britain's Jack Draper, who reached his first Masters 1000 semi-final with a 6-4, 7-5 victory over American Ben Shelton.Draper took the opening set with one break of serve then rallied from 0-3 down in a second-set slug-fest.Shelton's 32 unforced errors included five double-faults -- including one to hand Draper a break for 6-5 in the second.Russian Daniil Medvedev , runner-up to Alcaraz each of the past two years, rallied from a break down in a wild, wind-blown final set to beat Arthur Fils 6-4, 2-6, 7-6 (9/7).The world number six booked a semi-final meeting with Denmark's Holger Rune , a 5-7, 6-0, 6-3 winner over Tallon Griekspoor.Medvedev, a six-time Grand Slam finalist, trailed 20-year-old Fils 2-4 in the third set of a compelling clash that was momentarily paused as gusting winds sent towels and trash cans flying on Stadium Court.France's Fils had shown admirable maturity in the face of Medvedev's formidable defensive skills.He cut down on the unforced errors that marred his first set to win the second with ease and maintained his poise as he erased an early break in the third to seize the lead.But Medvedev wouldn't be denied and after forcing the tiebreaker prevailed on his third match point when Fils pushed a backhand volley long.Medvedev, who had won just one of his past nine third-set tiebreakers, gave a leap of sheer joy after securing the win in 2 hours and 25 minutes to keep alive his bid for a first title since 2023 -- when he won five.""I lost a lot of tight matches this year where I could have won, should have won maybe,"" Medvedev said. ""I have lost a lot of tight matches where it goes a little bit 50-50 and the more it goes like that, the more you can lose confidence in the tight moments.""I was happy I was able to get over the line as he saved some match points and had a break lead in the third. I am just happy to win.""Medvedev faces another young gun in Rune, who burst onto the scene in 2022 with a win over Novak Djokovic in the Paris Masters final.Rune has struggled often since, but after dropping the first set he dominated Griekspoor, the 43rd-ranked Dutchman who had ousted top-seeded Alexander Zverev in the second round.","Madison Keys crushes wild-card Belinda Bencic 6-1,6-1 in just 65 minutes to notch her 16th straight victory.

NEW DELHI: Mirra Andreeva ’s stunning rise in the WTA rankings has been so rapid that even the 17-year-old Russian admits she can’t quite keep up with it. Just last month in Dubai, she made history as the youngest-ever WTA 1000 champion , defeating both Grand Slam winners Iga Swiatek and Elena Rybakina on her way to the title — a win that catapulted her into the top 10 for the first time, landing at No. 9.Now at Indian Wells , Andreeva entered the tournament ranked 11th, but wins over Rybakina once again in the fourth round and Elina Svitolina in the quarter-finals are expected to lift her back into the top 10. Not that she’s been checking too closely.""Before, I was always checking live rankings because before I was playing for a dog,"" Andreeva said with a smile. ""So after every match I play I would check the live rankings to see if I did it.""That milestone — breaking into the top 20 — came after she defeated Magda Linette in Beijing last October. The reward? A promise of a dog. But even now, the pet hasn’t arrived yet, as she’s still narrowing down her choice.""I'm thinking to get an ultra mini labradoodle ,"" she revealed. ""It's going to be a labrador mixed with poodle and it's ultra min, so going to be even smaller than a mini version. It's going to take time until the dog that I want will be born.""While rankings may not be her primary focus anymore, Andreeva is channeling her energy into what’s right in front of her — like an upcoming semi-final clash at Indian Wells against defending champion Swiatek. Despite her recent win over the Pole in Dubai, she’s not expecting it to give her any advantage.""It doesn't give me any benefit to our match (on Friday),"" she admitted.Tennis has become increasingly serious for the teenager, but she's not letting that take the fun out of the game completely. The young star, who draws inspiration from athletes like Roger Federer and LeBron James, is trying to balance focus with enjoyment.""When I was a bit younger it would all be about having fun,"" Andreeva said. ""But now I start to understand that it's pretty serious what I do out here. I feel like when I have fun on the court I play great tennis, so I still try to not be super, super serious but also to have fun a little bit.""So while a top-10 return and a potential title shot are on the horizon, Andreeva remains grounded — eyes on the next match, and perhaps more importantly, on the tiny dog she’s patiently waiting for.","Mirra Andreeva's rise in the WTA rankings has been so rapid that even the 17-year-old Russian admits she can’t keep up with it.

CHENNAI: Sankar Muthusamy recorded the biggest win of his nascent career yet, defeating World No. 2 Anders Antonsen of Denmark 18-21, 21-12, 21-5 in the Swiss Open men’s singles pre-quarterfinals in Basel late on Thursday.What surprised many was the way in which the Indian dominated the deciding game. Despite losing the opener, the 21-year-old did not give up and pushed the match to the decider. He was helped by a flurry of unforced errors that Antonsen committed — the Dane hitting the shuttle wide and long on multiple occasions. Sankar made the most of the opportunity and succeeded.The Chennai lad entered the tournament as a qualifier and registered two wins to enter the main draw.“It feels good, and I have been doing well in this tournament. The first game (against Antonsen) lasted for close to 30 minutes and I feel that he became tired after that. I was able to score points from long rallies and capitalised on the situation. I was focusing on one point at a time and did not think much about the result,” Sankar, ranked 64th, told TOI from Basel.“In the deciding game, I was just expecting him to come back at me and was ready to handle the situation. My aim was to move him around the court and make him tired.”Sankar, who was a former junior World No. 1, lacked consistency in the 2024 season due to various reasons. However, he started the 2025 season on a bright note, reaching the quarterfinals of the Thailand Masters. He was later down with fever and could not give his best in the next few tournaments. However, Sankar recovered well ahead of the Swiss Open.The youngster, who is known for his defensive play, has improved his attacking skills and stroke-making.“My strokes have become sharper than usual, and I am able to finish off points from the rear court. My power is gradually increasing, and I am working on it. There is still a long way to go,” he said.Sankar’s long-time coach Aravindan Samiappan said that the win has come at the right time for his ward.“The moment has not sunk in properly. Sankar was an underdog and had nothing to lose. Our plan was to stay neck-to-neck on points and towards the end anything could have happened. But none would have expected such a scoreline in the decider. It was a bit shocking but that happens sometimes,” Aravindan said.The coach feels that opponents can no longer come prepared for Sankar, as he lends unpredictability into his game now.“Sankar can vary the pace of the match whenever required, and this was not the case one and a half years ago. Players could anticipate what he was going to do, as he played at a single pace. Now, you cannot predict him, and that is the major difference in his gameplay,” pointed out the coach.","Sankar Muthusamy defeated World No. 2 Anders Antonsen of Denmark 18-21, 21-12,. 21-5 in the Swiss Open men’s singles pre-quarterfinals in Basel late on Thursday.

NAGPUR: Malvika Bansod rallied from three points (14-17) down to clinch the first game but as luck would have it the 23-year-old world No.23 missed a chance to save the second match point in the decider to go down fighting against higher ranked Michelle Li of Canada, and bow out of the Swiss Open on Wednesday.Though Malvika suffered an early exit from the BWF World Tour Super 300 tournament, the world No.20 Li escaped to win the opening round contest against the Nagpur shuttler.
