NEW DELHI: Delhi high court judge Yashwant Varma has strongly denied allegations that a large sum of burnt currency was recovered from his official residence after a recent fire incident.In a lengthy letter to Delhi high court's chief justice, Devendra Kumar Upadhyaya, Justice Varma called the claims ""baseless"" and ""preposterous"", asserting that neither he nor his family had any connection to the alleged cash.""I state unequivocally that no cash was ever placed in that storeroom either by me or any of my family members and strongly denounce the suggestion that the alleged cash belonged to us,"" he wrote. ""The very idea or suggestion that this cash was kept or stored by us is totally preposterous.""Questioning the credibility of the allegations, he added, ""The suggestion that one would store cash in an open, freely accessible and commonly used storeroom near the staff quarters or in an outhouse verges on the incredible and incredulous.""Justice Varma said the accusations had severely damaged his reputation. ""In the life of a judge, nothing matters more than reputation and character. That has been severely tarnished and irreparably damaged,"" he stated.He dismissed any suggestion that he removed or handled currency at the site, saying, ""I categorically reject any suggestion that we removed currency from the storeroom. We were neither shown nor given any sacks of burnt currency. The limited debris recovered during the incident was confined to a particular section of the residence, and there was no evidence of any currency.""Drawing attention to his financial transparency, he mentioned that all his transactions were conducted through banks, UPI, and cards.

No evidence of forced entry into the storeroom was found.

The storeroom was used to store household items and was accessible to domestic staff, gardeners, and CPWD workers.

Some debris and half-burnt items were removed from the storeroom on the morning of March 15.

Given the seriousness of the allegations, Delhi high court Chief Justice Upadhyay has recommended a deeper probe.

The Supreme Court has directed Justice Varma to preserve all data and messages on his phone and has sought security records from the past six months.

Justice Varma has been relieved of judicial duties pending the inquiry's outcome.

SC sets up three-member inquiry panel



Supreme Court press release full document:



The Supreme Court on Saturday released an inquiry report by Delhi high court chief justice Devendra Kumar Upadhyay regarding Justice Yashwant Varma's case, which involved the discovery of burnt currency notes by firefighters at his official residence.A video shared by Delhi Police Commissioner Sanjay Arora with Chief Justice of India Sanjiv Khanna and Delhi high court chief justice Upadhyay purportedly shows the burnt cash, adding to the scrutiny.According to the report, on March 15, workers cleared some debris and partially burnt items from the storeroom. Subsequently, the Supreme Court instructed Justice Varma to maintain all phone data and communications. Additionally, the court requested records of security staff deployed at his residence over the previous six months. Justice Varma has been temporarily removed from his judicial responsibilities whilst the investigation continues.Also read: SC uploads video of burnt currency given by police, HC CJ suggests deeper probe; judge Yashwant Varma cries conspiracy Justice Varma has strongly denied any wrongdoing, calling the allegations an attempt to malign him. In his response to the inquiry panel, he stated that neither he nor his family had any connection to the cash allegedly found at the site.“My wife and I were not in Delhi at the time of the fire. The storeroom is a common area used by staff and is not part of my main residence. The claim that we kept cash there is absurd,” he said.Also read: Cash row inquiry report: 'No cash was ever placed in that storeroom', claims Justice Yashwant Varma Justice Varma also questioned the evidence, stating that when he inspected the storeroom after the fire, no cash was present. “Later, a video was shown to me suggesting otherwise. This raises serious concerns about evidence tampering,” he added.He further pointed to previous online allegations against him in December 2024, hinting at a possible effort to damage his reputation.The Supreme Court has set up a three-member inquiry panel to investigate the case. The committee includes Punjab & Haryana high court, chief justice Sheel Nagu, Himachal Pradesh high court chief justice G S Sandhawalia, and Karnataka high court judge Anu Sivaraman.With the inquiry now underway, the Supreme Court will review Justice Varma’s response along with forensic findings related to the alleged cash recovery. The panel will determine whether there is any direct link between the cash and the judge or his family.The court’s directive to preserve Justice Varma’s mobile data suggests that phone records and messages could play a role in the investigation. The case has sparked debate in legal and political circles, with concerns about both judicial integrity and possible attempts to frame the judge.The committee is expected to submit its findings to the Supreme Court in the coming weeks.","Fire broke out in a storeroom at Justice Yashwant Varma's official residence in New Delhi.

Fugitive businessman Mehul Choksi living in Belgium: Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/fugitive-businessman-mehul-choksi-living-in-belgium-report/articleshow/119362229.cms,"<p>Mehul Choksi<br></p>

NEW DELHI: Fugitive businessman Mehul Choksi is reportedly living in Belgium's Antwerp with his wife, Preeti Choksi, after securing an ‘F Residency Card’ in the country, according to a media report.Indian authorities have reportedly urged Belgium to initiate his extradition to India after knowing his whereabouts, the Associated Times reported.Choksi, accused of defrauding Punjab National Bank of over Rs 13,000 crore, obtained residency in Belgium and secured an 'F Residency Card' on November 15, 2023, reportedly facilitated by his wife, a citizen of Belgium. According to the Carribean-focused media outlet, Choksi had fabricated his documents to Belgian authorities and misrepresented his nationality in his application process, failing to disclose the details of his existing citizenship.It is believed that Choksi was believed to be living in Antigua and Barbuda before travelling to Belgium and is planning to move to Switzerland.The matter came days after Antigua and Barbuda’s Foreign Minister EP Chet Greene said that Choksi is no longer on the island.Greene, who was invited to participate in the Raisina Dialogue, did not reveal where Choksi had gone and noted, “Mehul Choksi is not on the island. I am told he left Antigua for medical attention abroad (but) he remains a citizen of Antigua and Barbuda. The governments, yours (India) and mine, are working together on this matter.”Choksi departed from India in January 2018 after being implicated in the PNB case. His nephew, Nirav Modi, was also implicated and currently awaits extradition proceedings in London.In May 2023, Choksi informed a Mumbai special court that circumstances beyond his control prevented his return to India, contesting the label of 'fugitive economic offender'. He claims he did not leave to avoid prosecution and is not refusing to return, adding that Indian authorities suspended his passport.The ED approached the special court seeking to designate him as a 'fugitive economic offender' for avoiding their summons and to enable confiscation of his assets under applicable legislation.In May 2021, his disappearance from Antigua led to speculation about abduction by Indian authorities - claims disproven when he was located in Dominica. Some suggested he attempted to avoid potential extradition.Dominican authorities arrested him for unlawful entry, but he returned to Antigua on medical grounds with interim bail. The proceedings were halted in May 2022.Choksi disputed the illegal entry allegations, stating that individuals posing as police officers took him from his restaurant, Jolly Roger in Antigua, to Dominica by boat.In December 2023, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman informed Parliament that assets valued at Rs 22,280 crore had been recovered or liquidated to settle debts of wanted persons including Choksi.","Indian authorities have reportedly urged Belgium to initiate his extradition to India.

'You rose to power promising a secular rule': Muslim body declines Bihar CM Nitish Kumar’s Iftaar invitation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/you-rose-to-power-promising-a-secular-rule-muslim-body-declines-bihar-cm-nitish-kumars-iftaar-invitation/articleshow/119361879.cms,"PTI photo

A major Muslim organisation in Bihar, the Imarat Shariah, has declined Chief Minister Nitish Kumar’s invitation for an Iftaar gathering on Sunday.The group, which has a strong following in Bihar, Jharkhand, and Odisha, cited Kumar’s support for the Waqf Bill as the reason. They claim the bill will worsen the economic and educational conditions of Muslims.In a letter responding to the invitation, the Imarat Shariah said, “A decision has been taken not to attend the government Iftaar on March 23. This decision is in protest against your support for the Waqf Bill, which threatens to increase the backwardness of Muslims,” quoted PTI.The organisation accused Kumar of breaking his promise to protect minority rights. ""You rose to power promising a secular rule in which minorities' rights were protected. But your alliance with the BJP and your support for legislation that is unconstitutional and illogical militate against your stated commitments,"" the Imarat Shariah alleged.The Imarat Shariah further criticised the Iftaar event, calling it “tokenism.” It claimed that the government’s indifference to Muslim concerns made such events meaningless.The JD(U) has traditionally counted on Muslim votes by presenting Kumar as a secular leader. The state elections are scheduled for later this year.The Janata Dal (United), has not responded to the boycott yet.The Jamiat Ulema-e-Hind had announced on Friday that it will no longer engage with such individuals as a ""symbolic protest."" The organisation also said that it will not take part in their events, including Iftaar and Eid Milan.The Waqf (Amendment) Bill is set to be presented in the Lok Sabha next week. The proposed changes aim to update the Waqf system. Key provisions include tighter regulations on the registration and oversight of Waqf properties.One of the most controversial aspects of the bill is the change in ownership rules, which would affect historical mosques, dargahs, and graveyards managed by the board.","The Imarat Shariah, a major Muslim organisation in Bihar, has declined Chief Minister Nitish Kumar’s invitation for an Iftaar gathering on Sunday.

Can Heathrow nightmare hit Indian airports?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/can-heathrow-nightmare-hit-indian-airports/articleshow/119361222.cms,"A question of backup

Where Indian airports stand

Pressure to make green break

How to avoid hiccups

The power outage that crippled London-Heathrow on Friday was not an isolated incident for the global airline industry, except for the scale of flight disruptions, which was unprecedented. Ask aviation experts and they’ll tell you that it’s more than just an operational mishap but a warning for the entire airline industry.International Air Transport Association (IATA) director general Willie Walsh voiced the questions now on everyone’s mind. “First, how is it that critical infrastructure, of national and global importance, is totally dependent on a single power source without an alternative? If that is the case, as it seems, then it is a clear planning failure by the airport.”Heathrow is the UK’s largest hub, handling over 1,300 flights a day. For comparison, Mumbai airport handles about 950 flights a day. Heathrow had to shut down after a fire at the North Hyde substation, located about 1.5 miles north of the airport, caused a “significant power outage”. A Heathrow spokesperson said “backup systems have been working as they should but they are not sized to run the entire airport”.Can such an incident occur at any airport in the world or was it merely a result of Heathrow’s legacy infrastructure? Experts said a substation fire may not be a risk unique to Heathrow, but it exposes the pitfalls of relying on a single external power source without sufficient backup systems or onsite supply in the form of solar, wind, or diesel generators, etc. Aviation norms ensure critical units like air traffic control towers, runway lighting, etc, are typically fed by uninterruptible power supply (UPS). The problem is with nonessential operations, the kind that involves operations at passenger terminals.Mumbai airport, India’s second largest airport with its two passenger terminals and one cargo terminal, consumes 26.9 MW power a day. “We receive power through two independent, redundant (back up) sources. In the event of a failure at one source, the other can seamlessly take over 100% of the power load to ensure operational continuity. Each terminal gets electricity from more than one power station,” said a Mumbai International Airport Ltd (MIAL) spokesperson.There are multiple pathways to deliver power to each terminal. “The system is designed to handle not just one failure, but two back-to-back failures without stopping operations. Both the terminals and the airfield have their own diesel generators, with a total capacity of 30 MW. These get activated in the case of a rare, major failure,” the official said. Mumbai airport runs on 100% renewable energy, 5% comes from on-site solar generation and 95% from hydro and wind energy. Bangalore International Airport Ltd (BIAL) said it uses a highly resilient and redundant power infrastructure for uninterrupted operations. “BLR airport receives power from Begur substation, which gets power through four independent supply lines from different substations,” said Hari Marar , MD and CEO, BIAL. “BIAL has also installed a separate transformer at the Begur substation dedicated for airport operations, minimising the risk of disruptions and also integrated on-site solar power generation and gone for tieups with off-site external renewable energy suppliers, ensuring a steady supply of green power,” he added.Unlike the 16-year old Bengaluru airport, many major airports rely on infrastructure designed long before modern digital systems and sustainability requirements became key concerns. While airports have kept upgrading facilities, many remain dependent on outdated power grids, centralised energy supply, and legacy IT systems that can be difficult to overhaul. Heathrow, for instance, opened in 1946 and expanded incrementally. Its electrical systems reflect a patchwork of upgrades rather than a fully modernised design, said an aviation expert.Most major hubs and airports of the world have started moving towards 2050 net-zero carbon emission goals (India’s net-zero target is set for 2070). In the coming decades, the demand for electricity at airports will see a steep rise as it powers everything from vehicles to aircraft. The move towards sustainable energy will happen even as terminal buildings and runways handle ever-increasing volumes of passengers and flights. Airports have begun preparing for this and “electrical resilience” has become a critical aspect of operations in recent years.All the 40 airports surveyed in a US study were found to be planning for or completing electrical infrastructure projects aimed at increasing their power resilience. These include removing overhead routes for an airport’s main feeder lines and taking those underground, and upgrading infrastructure to eliminate single points of failure. The latter is exactly the kind of upgrade that would prevent a Heathrow-like crisis.One of the most promising solutions — which began to find takers starting in the early 2000s — is the adoption of microgrids. These are localised grids that can operate independently or in tandem with the main grid, offering a self-sustained power supply. Microgrids can integrate renewable energy sources like solar and wind. Through these, and along with battery storage and backup generators, airports can reduce their reliance on external power sources. As airports move towards an increasingly electrified future, ensuring power reliability is no longer optional. Heathrow’s disruption should not just be another unfortunate event in aviation history — it should be a turning point.","Heathrow's power outage is a warning for the entire airline industry. Mumbai airport runs on 100% renewable energy, 5% comes from on-site solar generation and 95% from hydro and wind energy.

NAGPUR: A 38-year-old welder died Saturday from wounds suffered in Monday night's riots in Nagpur, becoming the first fatality linked to the violence over demands to remove Mughal emperor Aurangzeb's tomb from Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar.Sources said Irfan Shafiq Ahmed Ansari from Bande Garib Nawaz Nagar was caught in the crossfire while heading to Itwari station. His family demanded murder charges against rioters and compensation. CM Devendra Fadnavis promised strict action against rioters, including recovering the cost of property damage from them.Irfan Shafiq Ahmed Ansari, who was injured in the crossfire during the Nagpur riots, was found critically wounded and was taken by senior inspector Sanjay Singh to a hospital. Govt covered medical expenses of Ansari.Two men accused in Ansari's assault have been arrested.

""We will survey the damages and pay compensation to those whose vehicles or properties were damaged. The money will be disbursed in a week, but we will ensure it's collected from the rioters,"" he said. ""If they fail to pay up, their properties will be seized and sold to recover losses.""Fadnavis reviewed the law-and-order situation in affected areas and suggested a connection between the Nagpur riots and Malegaon, saying authorities were investigating involvement of international elements. He said PM Modi's scheduled visit to Nagpur for Gudi Padwa would proceed as planned.Police arrested alleged riot mastermind Fahim Khan's mentor M Hamid Engineer, president of Minorities Democratic Party, and web portal journalist Mohd Shahzad. Both were held late Friday night for allegedly inciting the riots and charged with sedition.Police sources said Engineer has provided leads regarding the Malegaon link mentioned by Fadnavis. Engineer, a long-time figure in minority politics, had allegedly flooded social media with inflammatory posts before the riots.His online appeal for contributions to ""Mujahideen"" raised speculation about his role in inciting violence in Nagpur. Engineer had been arrested earlier in 2011 for his alleged role in the Mominpura mob violence. Shahzad had circulated a speech by Khan that went viral. Both men were remanded in police custody for three days.A special committee from opposition Congress accused state govt and police of conducting a biased investigation, alleging that groups affiliated with the governing alliance were receiving ""silent support"" to incite violence.The delegation was denied permission Saturday to visit the riot-affected areas and warned of legal action if they defied the order.

Later, when the national anthem was played, he stood smiling and waving at bystanders.Kumar came under heavy opposition fire in both Houses of the state legislature for disrespecting the national anthem. His latest act led to much mirth and has given fodder to opposition parties, RJD and Congress, to exploit in the upcoming state polls, arguing he can't be given another term in view of his health condition.BJP, sources said, is confident of winning another term alongside JDU and LJP, but the party's worry is that Kumar's unexpected behaviour in the public glare has often given openings to opponents.The party, however, believes Kumar continues to be a valuable partner, and the memories of RJD's ""jungle raj"" will blunt any possibility of ""anti-incumbency"". Moreover, Kumar is credited with good governance and raising the bar in terms of performance which, BJP insiders feel, will help the alliance win another term.Of late, Kumar's behaviour has not followed a consistent pattern; there have been days when no mishaps took place and he appeared to be in control, like during his 'Pragati Yatra', even though he was in the public glare for several days. But there have been odd days when Kumar behaved in a manner that his opponents derided him, and his supporters found difficult to justify.

Supreme Court demands answers

The source of the unaccounted cash.

Three-judge inquiry panel formed

NEW DELHI: In a rare public disclosure, the Supreme Court on late Saturday night uploaded reports, photos, and videos related to allegations of unaccounted cash discovered at the official residence of Justice Yashwant Varma, a sitting judge of the Delhi High Court. The materials, now available on the court’s website, reveal the findings of an internal investigation and Justice Varma’s detailed response denying the allegations.The controversy erupted after a fire at Justice Varma’s official residence on March 14 led to the discovery of large quantities of cash. The Supreme Court’s decision to make these documents public signals the seriousness of the allegations and the judiciary’s commitment to transparency.According to the report by Delhi High Court Chief Justice Manmohan Upadhyay, the fire broke out in a storeroom of Justice Varma’s residence at approximately 11:30 PM on March 14. The fire was reported by Justice Varma’s personal secretary after being informed by household staff, reported Live Law.The next day, Chief Justice Upadhyay, along with the High Court’s Registrar, visited the bungalow and personally inspected the scene. The report mentions that the storeroom was located separately from the main living quarters and had limited access to Justice Varma’s servants, gardeners, and occasionally CPWD staff.The Delhi Police Commissioner shared with Chief Justice Upadhyay images and videos from the scene, which showed sacks of cash—some of it burnt. The Supreme Court has now released these materials publicly, offering an unprecedented look into the case.When shown the photographs of the cash, Justice Varma expressed concerns about a potential conspiracy against him. In his formal response to the Chief Justice of India, he categorically denied any connection to the cash or knowledge of how it arrived in the storeroom.“I unequivocally state that no cash was ever placed in that storeroom by me or any of my family members. The suggestion that this cash belonged to us is preposterous. The storeroom is an open, commonly used area near staff quarters, disconnected from my living spaces,” Justice Varma stated.He also criticized the media for what he described as premature and defamatory reporting. “I only wish that the media had conducted some enquiry before I came to be indicted and defamed in the press,” his response added.Following the initial inquiry, Chief Justice of India Sanjiv Khanna instructed Chief Justice Upadhyay to seek further clarification from Justice Varma on three critical points:Justice Varma has been explicitly asked not to delete any data from his phone.In light of the findings, the Supreme Court has formed a three-member committee to conduct an in-depth in-house inquiry. The panel members are Justice Sheel Nagu (Chief Justice, Punjab & Haryana High Court), Justice GS Sandhawalia (Chief Justice, Himachal Pradesh High Court) and Justice Anu Sivaraman (Judge, Karnataka High Court).Additionally, Justice Varma has been temporarily relieved from judicial duties. The Delhi High Court Chief Justice has been instructed not to assign him any further cases pending the outcome of the inquiry.","The Supreme Court on late Saturday night uploaded reports, photos, and videos related to allegations of unaccounted cash discovered at the official residence of Justice Yashwant Varma.

NEW DELHI: The mother of Meerut man Saurabh Rajput , who was allegedly murdered by his wife Muskan Rustogi and her lover Sahil Shukla, has made an emotional appeal for justice, demanding the strictest punishment for those responsible. She has urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath to intervene and ensure a thorough investigation into the case.Speaking to ANI, Saurabh’s mother expressed her deep anguish and also called for her granddaughter to be brought to them. ""She is our granddaughter; we have the right to see her. If the mother could harm her own husband, what if she did something to the child too? We haven't seen her since the incident, and we want to keep her with us,"" she said.She also questioned how her son’s wife managed to escape after committing such a crime. ""Where did she find the courage to kill her husband and leave so easily? She is roaming freely with her lover. Who is he? Where did she go with him? There must have been some planning behind this. She did not act alone,"" she added.Demanding the death penalty for those involved, she said, ""Those responsible for my son's murder should be hanged. I appeal to Modi ji and Yogi ji for justice. The investigation should be conducted by any agency — crime branch, CBI, or anyone — but I need to know every detail. What happened? What was the reason? Was there a fight between them? I need all the answers.""Saurabh's mother also questioned the events leading up to the murder. ""If my son had been facing such serious problems, he would have told me something.

'Asked driver to bring a cake'

Sahil, Muskan's Holi celebration

Post-mortem reveals chilling details



NEW DELHI: Muskan Rastogi and her lover Sahil Shukla appeared to have planned an elaborate getaway in the wake of their shocking crime. The duo, accused of murdering Muskan’s husband, former Merchant Navy officer Saurabh Rajput , attempted to evade the authorities by fleeing to Himachal Pradesh immediately after the gruesome act. On March 4, Rajput was drugged, stabbed, dismembered, and his remains were concealed within a cement-filled drum in a chilling murder plot.Immediately after the murder, the pair drove away from Meerut and reached Kasol, in Himachal Pradesh, where they checked into a local hotel on March 10. During their six-day stay, they maintained an unusually low profile.According to the hotel operator, the couple presented themselves as husband and wife and remained secluded in their room, rarely venturing out, as reported by PTI. They avoided interactions with the staff, refused routine housekeeping, and left the room only once daily in a private car.According to PTI sources, Muskan's online conversations and audio exchanges with the cab driver, who transported her and her lover to Himachal Pradesh, were widely shared on social media.""One of the videos revealed that Muskan had sent a voice message to the driver via WhatsApp, requesting him to bring a cake,"" the police said.Another video showed Muskan celebrating her birthday with Sahil, feeding him cake. The duo smiling at the camera, their faces smeared with colours after celebrating Holi, with loud music blaring in the background.The calculated silence of Muskan and Sahil did little to disguise their frantic attempts at cover-up. Their actions were designed to create an illusion of normality; at check-out, they casually informed the hotel operator that they were returning from Manali en route to Uttar Pradesh.Also read: Muskan Rastogi, her lover Sahil Shukla played Holi days after murdering Saurabh Rajput Meanwhile, back in Meerut, a complaint from Rajput’s family finally set the wheels of justice in motion. The case gained momentum when Muskan’s father, Pramod Rastogi, compelled his daughter to confess the horrific details of the murder while on a scooter ride to the police station. It emerged that Muskan, under coercion and influence, had participated in the murder alongside Sahil—her accomplice who allegedly manipulated her into committing the unthinkable.The post-mortem of Saurabh Rajput revealed shocking details about his murder. His head was severed, both hands were amputated, and his legs were bent backward, indicating an attempt to fit the body into a drum. The autopsy confirmed he was stabbed three times in the heart, causing severe bleeding and shock. After dismembering his body, it was sealed in a drum filled with cement, preserving it. The body had to be painstakingly retrieved by cutting open the cement-filled drum.Police investigations soon uncovered that the body, dismembered and sealed in a cement drum, had been recovered from a house, leading to the arrest of both Muskan and Sahil on March 18. During questioning, Sahil reportedly confessed that on the night of the murder he had instructed Muskan: “You have to kill Saurabh if we are to start a new life.” He allegedly directed her to sit on her unconscious husband’s chest and, when she hesitated, guided her hand as she stabbed him in the heart three times.Adding another layer to the case, neighbours recalled Sahil’s eerie behaviour; he was often seen wearing kurtas adorned with ‘Mahakal’ inscriptions and was known for his reclusive habits, such as feeding stray cats and keeping his room cloaked in darkness.Muskan’s mother, Kavita, expressed her anguish and regret that her daughter had never confided in her, attributing Muskan’s secrecy to the possibility of being influenced by drugs or other undisclosed factors.","Muskan Rastogi and her lover Sahil Shukla appeared to have planned an elaborate getaway in the wake of their shocking crime.

Any delimitation exercise carried out by the Union Government to improve the content and character of democracy should be carried out transparently, enabling political parties of all the States, State Governments and other stakeholders to deliberate, discuss and contribute in it.

Given the fact that the legislative intent behind the 42nd, 84th and 87th Constitutional amendments was to protect / incentivise States which have implemented population control measures effectively and the goal of national population on stabilisation has not yet been achieved, the freeze Parliamentary constituencies based on 1971 Census Population, should be extended by another 25 years.

The States which have effectively implemented the population control program and consequently whose population share has come down, should not be penalised. The Union Government must enact necessary constitutional amendments for this purpose.

The Core Committee consisting of Members of Parliament from the represented States will coordinate the parliamentary strategies to counter any attempts by the Union Government to undertake any delimitation exercise contrary to the principles mentioned above.

The Core Committee of MPs shall submit a Joint Representation on the above lines to the Hon'ble Prime Minister of India during the ongoing Parliamentary session.

The Political Parties from different states represented in the meeting will initiate efforts to bring about appropriate Legislative Assembly resolutions in their respective States on the issue and communicate the same to Union Government.

The JAC will also undertake necessary efforts to disseminate information on the history and context of past delimitation exercises and the consequences of the proposed delimitation among the citizens of their respective States, through a coordinated public opinion mobilization strategy.

Tamil Nadu chief minister MK Stalin on Saturday convened the inaugural meeting of the Joint Action Committee (JAC) in Chennai, aimed at opposing the central government's proposed delimitation exercise . This initiative has garnered significant attention from various southern states, which fear that the exercise could undermine their political representation and rights.Stalin described the meeting as a ""historic day"" for India's federal structure, emphasising that it marked the beginning of a movement to safeguard the interests of states that have effectively implemented population control measures .""Today will be etched in history as the day when states that have contributed to our nation's development came together to safeguard its federal structure by ensuring fair delimitation,"" said CM Stalin.Stalin's remarks underscored concerns that if the delimitation proceeds based on future census data, states like Tamil Nadu could lose parliamentary representation, which he argued would compromise their rights and erode democracy itself.""This is more than a meeting. It is the beginning of a movement that will shape the future of our country,"" he said at the start of the meeting.The meeting was attended by leaders from several southern states, including Kerala, Telangana, and Punjab. However, it faced opposition from Tamil Nadu's BJP faction, which staged protests against the JAC's proceedings.Stalin futher said that the next meeting of the JAC would take place in Hyderabad, urging all opposition parties to unite against what he termed an unfair delimitation process.","Tamil Nadu chief minister MK Stalin convened the inaugural meeting of the Joint Action Committee (JAC) in Chennai.

NEW DELHI/MUMBAI: Four-and-a half years after it began probing the death of actor Sushant Singh Rajput , the CBI is learned to have closed the case and given a clean chit to actor Rhea Chakraborty , bringing curtains on a case that had gripped the country, reports Rajshekhar Jha. Rajput was found dead at his Bandra flat on June 14, 2020.The probe agency is learned to have filed a closure report in two of the cases it was investigating, sources said. While one case was filed in Aug 2021 in Patna by Rajput's father against Rhea, her kin and others, the other was filed in Sept by Rhea against Rajput's sister and doctor.The closure report in both was filed in a special Mumbai court, sources said.Rhea's lawyer Satish Maneshinde said, ""Rhea Chakraborty had to undergo untold miseries and was behind bars for 27 days for no fault of hers until Justice Sarang V Kotwal released her on bail. I salute her and her family for having kept silent and yet suffered the inhuman treatment they were meted out. Innocent people were hounded and paraded before the media and investigative authorities.

Mumbai police , which first probed the case, termed it as a case of suspected suicide, although no suicide note had been found. The provisional post-mortem suggested the cause of death was asphyxia due to hanging.Coincidentally, on Wednesday, Disha's father Satish Salian alleged his daughter was gangraped and murdered. He has filed a plea demanding a CBI probe into her death, alleging that Rajput was visibly frightened and repeatedly expressed fear that ""those people"" responsible for her death would not spare him and that he would be killed. He has said both deaths are interconnected and part of a larger conspiracy.The CBI FIR in Rajput's case named Rhea and her kin Indrajit Chakraborty, Sandhya and Showik apart from her associates Samuel Miranda and Shruti Modi.The FIR, initially filed by Bihar police , had sections of IPC related to criminal conspiracy, abetment of suicide, wrongful restraint, wrongful confinement, theft, criminal breach of trust, cheating and criminal intimidation.After Rajput's cremation at Vile Parle's Pawan Hans crematorium, Mumbai police began their investigation, recording statements from film and casting director Mukesh Chhabra, Rajput's girlfriend Rhea, and his managerial staff. In July that year, producer Sanjay Leela Bhansali was questioned, stating he had offered Rajput four films, but eventually featured in none.Rhea, who confirmed being in a relationship with Rajput on Twitter (now X), demanded a CBI inquiry. Mumbai police also recorded statements of filmmaker Aditya Chopra and three psychiatrists.Meanwhile, an FIR was registered against Rhea in Patna on July 28, and a team of Bihar police reached Mumbai to probe the case.The Enforcement Directorate inquired about the money laundering angle in the case and questioned Rhea but they found no substance against her. Subsequently, the NCB initiated a probe against her along with others on allegations of procurement of drugs for Rajput which led to her arrest. In Aug 2021, the CBI filed an FIR against Rhea and others, and the ED too summoned her for questioning.An AIIMS forensic team was roped in by the CBI on Aug 22, and the ED unearthed a drug angle in the case, involving the Narcotics Control Bureau .In Sept 2021, Rhea filed an FIR against Rajput's sisters and doctor, which was transferred to the CBI as well.This is the second case which has been closed as well, sources said.In Oct, reports emerged that the AIIMS panel had dismissed the murder theory, although the CBI stated they were probing all angles.","CBI closes actor Sushant Singh Rajput death case, clears Rhea Chakraborty.

A three-member committee has been constituted by Chief Justice of India Sanjiv Khanna to conduct an inquiry into allegations against Justice Yashwant Varma , a sitting Judge of the High Court of Delhi. The committee comprises Justice Sheel Nagu, Chief Justice of the High Court of Punjab & Haryana, Justice GS Sandhawalia, Chief Justice of the High Court of Himachal Pradesh, and Anu Sivaraman, Judge of the High Court of Karnataka.Allegations surfaced against Justice Varma after a fire at his official residence led to the alleged discovery of a significant amount of cash. Initial reports put the amount at Rs 15 crore, although this figure has not been officially confirmed.The Supreme Court's in-house inquiry procedure dictates that when allegations arise against a High Court judge, the Chief Justice of India, after a preliminary inquiry, forms a committee of three judges to investigate the matter after seeking a response from the judge in question.Significantly, the Chief Justice of the High Court of Delhi for the time being has been asked not to assign any judicial work to Justice Yashwant Varma. The report submitted by the Chief Justice of the High Court of Delhi, response of Justice Yashwant Varma, and other documents, are being uploaded on the Supreme Court website.Following the alleged discovery of the unaccounted cash, the Supreme Court collegium had convened a meeting and the Chief Justice of the High Court of Delhi, D K Upadhyay, was asked to file a report regarding the allegations against Justice Varma. The report was submitted on March 21.In another decision, which the SC has clarified was not connected to the allegations, Justice Varma was transferred back to his parent court in Allahabad.The Supreme Court has emphasised that the proposal for Justice Varma's transfer was independent of any ongoing inquiry into the cash allegations.In February 2018, the Central Bureau of Investigation had named Justice Varma as an accused in the Simbhaoli Sugar Mill fraud case involving a ₹97.85 crore loan misappropriation. Justice Varma was a non-executive director of the company at the time. Although the CBI launched a probe, the case seemingly lost momentum, and a subsequent court order to resume the investigation was overturned by the Supreme Court in 2024, effectively ending the inquiry.","Allegations surfaced against Justice Varma after a fire at his official residence led to the alleged discovery of a significant amount of cash.

NEW DELHI: Two months after it conducted searches on the premises of a railway claims tribunal judge in Patna, R K Mittal, and his associates in a case of Rs 50 crore fraudulent withdrawal of death compensations, ED on Friday attached 24 properties belonging to the accused.This was not the first time the agency had acted against a judge accused of alleged bribery or association with fraudsters engaged in fixing benches and cultivating judges for favourable judgments. Apart from the known instances, the agency is also learned to be keeping a close surveillance on conflicts of interest of judges and alleged efforts to bribe them.On Aug 10 in 2023, ED arrested Panchkula's former special court judge Sudhir Parmar in connection with alleged bribery and for favouring accused in a money laundering case against real estate developer IREO and its promoter Lalit Goyal.Goyal was arrested by the agency just a month before it took Parmar into custody. Panchkula's special CBI court judge was suspended by Punjab and Haryana high court in April that year after agencies produced ""incriminating evidence"" against him for allegedly favouring the IREO promoters accused in a money laundering investigation .ED later arrested Goyal's associates and promoters of M3M, Basant Bansal and Pankaj Bansal, in a separate case. ED in its remand note had claimed that ""Sudhir Parmar (the Panchkula judge) was showing favouritism to the accused Roop Bansal, his brother Basant Bansal, the owners of M3M, and Lalit Goyal, the owner of IREO Group, in lieu of undue advantages"".In yet another case, while probing the Chhattisgarh PDS scam pertaining to the period of the previous Congress-led govt of Bhupesh Baghel, ED came across evidence of alleged liaisoning between two senior IAS officers who were accused in the case and a judge of the Chhattisgarh high court influencing the trial.ED brought the issue to the notice of Supreme Court, which transferred the judge in question to Patna high court, an action similar to what the SC collegium had proposed in case of a judge of Delhi high court after alleged recovery of a huge pile of cash from his residence.In the case of Chhattisgarh HC judge, as reported by TOI, ED had told SC that two IAS officers, Anil Tuteja and Alok Shukla, ""were in touch with the high court judge who granted bail to Shukla"". The agency further alleged that the then advocate general of the state had been liaising between the two accused and the judge, indirectly alleging quid pro quo in relief granted to the babus under investigation in the PDS scam.","Two months after it conducted searches on the premises of a railway claims tribunal judge in Patna, R K Mittal, and his associates, ED attached 24 properties belonging to the accused.

NEW DELHI: Noting that a woman who is employed and holds the same post as her husband and can take care of herself independently, Supreme Court has turned down her plea seeking maintenance from her estranged husband.A bench of Justices Abhay S Oka and Ujjal Bhuyan refused to grant relief to the woman who is working as an assistant professor and sought maintenance from her husband.

Opposing her plea, advocate Shashank Singh, appearing for the husband, told the court that she was earning around Rs 60,000 per month and both of them were holding the post of the same grade.But the wife pleaded that she was entitled to maintenance and the wife's earning capacity and qualification cannot automatically absolve the husband of his obligation to provide maintenance. She told the bench that her husband was earning around Rs 1 lakh per month. As there was dispute over their monthly salaries, the court had directed both of them to place before it the salary slip of the last one year.Wife approached the apex court after her plea of maintenance was rejected by Madhya Pradesh HC and a trial court.","A bench of Justices Abhay S Oka and Ujjal Bhuyan refused to grant relief to the woman who is working as an assistant professor and sought maintenance from her husband.

'Why Ghosh went to inaugurate the road?'

'Opportunists protesting for 500 rupees'

NEW DELHI: Dilip Ghosh on Friday threatened to ""choke"" a woman protester confronting the former West Bengal Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) chief over inauguration of a newly-constructed road in Kharagpur.The incident took place at Kharagpur's ward No. 6 where Ghosh arrived to inaugurate the concrete road. Upon his arrival, a group of women surrounded him, questioning his absence during his tenure as a Member of Parliament.""Where have you been all this time? We never saw you even for a day when you were an MP. Now, after our councillor (Trinamool's Pradip Sarkar) has built the road, you're here?"" they asked the ex-Lok Sabha member, according to news agency PTI.Ghosh, who did not remain silent, claimed that the protesters were supporters of the ruling Trinamool Congress.He responded aggressively, saying, ""I have given the money for this (road); it is not your father's money! Go and ask Pradip Sarkar about it!""The argument quickly escalated, with one of the women retorting, ""Why bring up our father? You were an MP!""To this, the politician replied, ""I will bring up your fourteen generations! Don't scream like that, I'll choke you. I have given money for this from my MPLAD fund during my tenure as a parliamentarian.""As the situation threatened to spiral out of control, the BJP leader's security personnel, along with party workers, intervened.Police from Kharagpur Town police station also arrived at the scene.However, the protests intensified as women surrounded Ghosh's car, with many seen hitting the vehicle.Eventually, Ghosh had to leave the area.Local councillor Sarkar, a former Kharagpur MLA, condemned Ghosh's actions.He said, ""He (Ghosh) is no longer an MP, so why did he go to inaugurate the road? The municipality completed the roadwork because it's a low-lying area. He went there and lost his temper, disrespecting the women by bringing up their fathers!""Sarkar added, ""I was not there, but he even insulted my father. He called the women 500-rupee workers. He should apologise. I condemn his remarks. Such language is unbecoming of a former MP.""Meanwhile, speaking to reporters, Ghosh claimed that the protest was ""politically orchestrated"" by the Trinamool Congress.""This is not a protest. These are opportunists barking for 500 rupees. Those who bark, Dilip Ghosh will bring up their fathers,"" the senior Bharatiya Janata Party leader stated, mentioning the monthly amount under Lakshmir Bhandar, the West Bengal government's financial assistance scheme for women.He further explained, ""I had worked for the construction of this stretch of road with the MPLAD fund money that was sanctioned during my tenure. I went there to inaugurate it, but at the instruction of the local councillor, a few women came to protest. When Pradip Sarkar was chairman, I was an MLA. Even now, Kharagpur municipality has stalled many of my funded projects.""","Dilip Ghosh was inaugurating a road in Kharagpur, West Bengal.

'Cash at home' row: CJI sets up 3-judge panel to probe into allegations against Justice Yashwant Varma,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/cash-at-home-row-cji-sets-up-3-judge-panel-to-probe-into-allegations-against-justice-yashwant-varma/articleshow/119356755.cms,"No time limit fixed by CJI for panel to complete inquiry

NEW DELHI: Acting swiftly on Delhi high court chief justice D K Upadhyay's adverse report against Justice Yashwant Varma on the alleged discovery of a huge pile of cash at his residence, CJI Sanjiv Khanna Saturday appointed a three-judge panel , comprising two HC chief justices and one HC judge, to inquire into the charges.In another important decision, CJI Khanna has asked the Delhi HC chief justice ""not to assign any judicial work to Justice Varma for the time being"", which would mean he is barred from doing any judicial work till the inquiry panel submits its report to the CJI.This also means that the March 20 decision of the CJI-led five-judge collegium to repatriate Justice Varma to his parent Allahabad HC would be kept in abeyance till the panel concludes inquiry and submits its report.The Allahabad HC Bar Association had questioned the decision of the collegium, led by CJI Khanna, and comprising Justices B R Gavai, Surya Kant, A S Oka and Vikram Nath, asking if Allahabad HC was a ""trash bin"". The panel comprising Punjab and Haryana HC CJ Sheel Nagi, Himachal Pradesh HC CJ GS Sandhawalia, and Karnataka HC's Anu Sivaraman will ""inquire into the allegations against Justice Varma, a sitting judge of the Delhi HC,"" the SC said in a late evening press release. No time limit has been fixed by the CJI for the panel to complete inquiry proceedings.On March 14, the day of Holi celebrations, a fire had allegedly broken out in the small hours of the night at Justice Varma's official residence at Tughlaq Road in the heart of Lutyens Delhi. The police and fire brigade rushed to the spot to douse the fire and allegedly stumbled upon a huge pile of cash in one of the outhouses of the bungalow. This was reported to the higher-ups who, in turn, informed the CJI on March 15. On the same day, the CJI had asked the Delhi HC CJ to submit a report on the incident along with Justice Varma's explanation about the alleged reovery of cash. The SC had said on Friday, ""On receiving the information, theDelhi HC CJ commenced the in-house inquiry procedure collecting evidence and information prior to the collegium meeting on March 20.""On March 20, the five-judge collegium met and decided to transfer Justice Varma to Allahabad HC, his parent HC from where he was brought to Delhi HC in 2021. The collegium had sought the opinions of consultee judges - Justices Manoj Misra (from Allahabad HC) and Justice Manmohan (who was CJ of Delhi HC prior to his recent appointment as SC judge).Justice Varma had risen to number two in seniority in Delhi HC and would have ended ninth in the seniority list in Allahabad HC had he been shifted there. If the inquiry panel submits an adverse report, Justice Varma would have no option but to resign as his refusal would force the hands of CJI Khanna to recommend the Union govt to initiate the removal process in Parliament, which is similar to the process applicable for removal of SC judges. Article 124(4) of the Constitution provides: ""A judge of SC shall not be removed from his office except by an order of President passed after an address by each House of Parliament supported by a majority of the total membership of that House and by a majority of not less than two-third of the members of the House present and voting has been presented to President in the same session for such removal on the ground of proved misbehaviour or incapacity.""","CJI Sanjiv Khanna Saturday appointed a three-judge panel to inquire into the charges.

Modi’s presence at G7 uncertain as Canada says no decision on summit invitations,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pm-modi-presence-at-g7-uncertain-as-canada-is-yet-to-finalise-invites/articleshow/119356690.cms,"NEW DELHI: With barely 3 months to go for the G7 summit in Canada, suspense looms over PM Narendra Modi's participation in the event. Modi has been a regular at G7 since 2019 but, asked about whether India will be invited for this year's summit, host Canada told TOI no decision has been taken yet about participation of guest countries.Canada’s ongoing G7 presidency will see it hosting the summit on June 15-17 in Kananaskis, Alberta, at a time its bilateral ties with India remain frosty and in the middle of an unprecedented crisis with the US provoked by a nasty tariff war. The foreign ministers of the group of economically most advanced nations put up a show of unity in Charlevoix earlier this month reaffirming their “unwavering” support for Ukraine but the G7 has been riddled with concerns about Trump’s treatment of allies and his reluctance to call out Russia for its aggression.“No decisions on summit invitations have been taken at this time. More information will be made available in due time,’’ said a Canadian official with the G7 media relations team. Both Modi and his predecessor Manmohan Singh have in the past been invited for G7 summits. Modi, in fact, has been a regular since 2019, when French President Emmanuel Macron invited him for the meeting in Biarritz. Then the Trump administration too had invited him for the Camp David summit in 2020, although it was called off later because of Covid-19.It's learnt that former PM Justin Trudeau, widely blamed for wrecking ties with India with his slapdash approach to the Khalistan murder plot, may have left the choice of guests to his successor. The new PM, Mark Carney, has said he wants to rebuild ties with India but is currently saddled with the unenviable task of dealing with Trump’s adventurism. Carney has also said he wants to create trading relationships with new partners, and to build the strongest economy in the G7. Apparently, limited space at the summit venue might also be a factor in having very few, or even no, guest leaders.Carney has so far been silent on Khalistan supporter Hardeep Singh Nijjar’s killing that caused a dramatic downturn in ties, including a downgrading of the diplomatic relationship. India has said it hopes to rebuild ties based on mutual trust and sensitivity but will probably wait to see the outcome of the next elections that Carney is likely to call soon and will be held, according to reports from Canada, on April 28. While it’s fashionable here to blame Trudeau for the current status of ties, the RCMP, which has investigated the case, maintains that Trudeau’s position was informed by information provided by the agency.","Modi has been a regular at G7 since 2019 but, asked about whether India will be invited for this year's summit, host Canada told TOI no decision has been taken yet.
