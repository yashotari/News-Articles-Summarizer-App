HQ sale in line with Cognizant's consolidation efforts

In a significant real estate transaction, Cognizant Technology Solutions , a leading US-based IT company, has sold its 13.68-acre prime property in Okkiyam Thoraipakkam, off Chennai's Old Mahabalipuram Road (OMR), for Rs 612 crore. The sale, registered earlier this week, at the Neelankarai sub-registrar's office, marks the end of an era for Cognizant's India headquarters, which had been based at the Thoraipakkam complex for over two decades. The property, Cognizant's first fully owned campus in Chennai, holds historical significance for the company.It served as the operational base for co-founders Lakshmi Narayanan and Chandrasekaran and witnessed a landmark event when Cognizant remotely rang the Nasdaq opening bell, signifying a major milestone in its growth. The move to the Thoraipakkam complex had previously elevated Cognizant from its rented space in the CSI building near the US Consulate.The sale aligns with Cognizant's ongoing efforts to consolidate its operations within three of its own buildings at MEPZ, Sholinganallur, and Siruseri. The company had put the property on the market in August last year, engaging international property advisory firm JLL to facilitate the transaction. After discussions with several prospective buyers, including local developers Baashyaam Group and Casagrand, Bengaluru-based real estate developer Bagamane Group emerged as the successful bidder.The transaction, which included a Rs 55.08 crore payment to the Tamil Nadu government for stamp duty and registration fees, was initially targeted for completion by December 2024. Although the process extended nearly three months beyond the anticipated timeline, Cognizant vacated the campus by the end of December in preparation for the handover. The company has also been relinquishing leased spaces across Chennai, including prominent locations such as Ramanujan IT Park, DLF, and its office on St Mary’s Road in R A Puram.With the sale finalized, Cognizant's new India headquarters is set to operate from the MEPZ campus near Tambaram on GST Road. Meanwhile, the Bagamane Group is set to redevelop the Thoraipakkam property, possibly building high-rise mixed-use towers—a growing trend along OMR, Chennai’s vibrant IT corridor.","Cognizant Technology Solutions has sold its 13.68-acre prime property in Okkiyam Thoraipakkam, off Chennai's Old Mahabalipuram Road.

Reluctant to leave the platform he admired for its user experience, Jha sent what he described as a ""last-ditch email"" to Kamath, expecting no reply.Within ten minutes, Kamath personally responded, triggering a comprehensive action plan from his team.

Accenture becomes first consulting company to be 'hit' by DOGE

The US President Donald Trump administration is intensifying its investigation into federal consultancies, such as Booz Allen Hamilton Holding Corp and Accenture Plc, demanding that these companies describe their work in clear, simple terms rather than ""jargon or gobbledygook,"" Bloomberg reports. According to a letter seen by Bloomberg News, Josh Gruenbaum, the General Services Administration’s new top procurement official, wrote to the 10 highest-paid consulting companies serving the government, requesting detailed information about their billions in government contracts and their plans to ""reduce or eliminate spend."" Gruenbaum warned, ""Do not submit a scorecard that does not identify any waste and spend reduction opportunities,"" adding that submissions failing to highlight cost savings would lack credibility and signal misalignment with the administration’s cost-cutting objectives.Gruenbaum, a former private equity executive and investment banker from KKR & Co. and Moelis & Co., appointed by President Donald Trump to oversee GSA procurement, instructed the consulting companies to submit pricing reduction recommendations by March 31 in language ""a 15-year-old should be able to understand."" This follows GSA’s earlier directive to federal agencies to justify their contracts with consultancies, including major players like Deloitte Consulting LLP, Bloomberg report adds.Earlier this week, Accenture’s stock dropped after the company reported a slowdown in its US government work, tied to Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency push to cut the federal workforce and budget. CEO Julie Sweet said at the earnings call that federal services made up about 8% of Accenture’s global revenue and 16% of its Americas revenue in fiscal 2024. Meanwhile, Science Applications International Corp., another firm in DOGE ’s sights, said its contracts have seen minimal impact so far but acknowledged potential shifts as the administration ramps up its fight against ""waste, fraud and abuse.""The report highlights that the federal government spent $759 billion on contracts in 2023, relying on external firms for professional services, tech support, and R&D, per Government Accountability Office data. Supporters argue this outsourcing saves money by leveraging outside expertise. Other targeted firms include IBM, General Dynamics, Leidos, Guidehouse, HII Mission Technologies, and CGI Federal, none of which immediately commented on GSA’s letter.GSA is requiring these consultants to submit a form detailing payments from agencies between 2019 and 2024, their work types, and pricing models. Bloomberg News also reports that GSA has already terminated 1,700 consulting contracts, based on internal agency data provided earlier this week.","US President Donald Trump administration is intensifying its investigation into federal consultancies.

Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella recently reacted to a video featuring cricket legend Sachin Tendulkar and Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, sparking curiosity about a possible collaboration between the two. The playful clip, shared by Tendulkar on X, introduces a hybrid sport called ""Crennis""—a fusion of cricket and tennis. Responding to the video, Nadella wrote “Looks like I found my next sport! I look forward to trying my hand at Crennis with you both,” tagging Bill Gates and Sachin Tendulkar in the post.In the video, Gates looks at Tendulkar’s stance with a tennis racket and remarks, “I thought we were playing tennis.” Tendulkar playfully corrects him, saying, “Bill, I said Crennis—a little bit of cricket and a little bit of tennis.” The duo then engages in a lighthearted match, with Tendulkar calling Gates ""out"" using an informal street cricket rule: “One tip, one hand—Gully Crennis.”At one point, Gates is seen reading a book titled Rules of Crennis, as they continue their unconventional game, blending cricket techniques with tennis elements on a tennis court.The video wraps up with Gates asking, “Call it even?” to which Tendulkar agrees, replying, “Done.” The two then enjoy a classic Mumbai snack, vada pav, rounding off the fun-filled exchange.The post is captioned “Sport teaches us teamwork, life demands the same. Crennis was fun, but the real action is brewing with Sachin Tendulkar Foundation & Gates Foundation.”Earlier this week, Gates posted a similar video on Instagram. In the video, Gates and Tendulkar are seen sitting on a bench, enjoying vada pav together. The clip ends with the caption, “Serving soon.” Gates captioned the post, “A snack break before we get to work.”No other details about the potential project between Gates andTendulkar are known yet.","Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella reacted to a video featuring Sachin Tendulkar and Bill Gates.

What are NYT Strands and how to play the game?



Strands is a puzzle game that blends elements of Connections, Spelling Bee, and classic crossword puzzles. Players are given 48 letters arranged on a 6 x 8-inch grid, along with a daily theme. The goal is to solve the Spangram and uncover all the theme-related words.

To play, connect letters on the grid to form words by dragging your mouse or fingers (on a touchscreen) in horizontal, vertical, or diagonal directions.

Start by identifying the central theme word or Spangram, which will help you understand the puzzle’s theme.

In addition to the Spangram, you must also find other words related to the theme hidden in the grid. Once you’ve uncovered them all, the puzzle is complete.

Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu replies to Kerala Congress' RIP post for 'Make in India',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/zoho-founder-sridhar-vembu-replies-to-kerala-congress-rip-post-for-make-in-india/articleshow/119109476.cms,"Here’s a look at Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu’s post

Sridhar Vembu’s comparison between financial bubbles and flash floods

Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu recently replied to an X post by Kerala Congress , emphasizing the progress of the Make in India initiative and Zoho’s recent expansion in Kerala. The image in the party’s post shows a tombstone design to symbolically critique the ""Make in India"" initiative, suggesting it has failed between 2014 and 2025. The tombstone features the Indian lion emblem and the phrase ""Rest in Peace.""The post is captioned “In loving memory of….”. Responding to the post, Vembu emphasized the Make in India initiative and Zoho’s expansion in Kerala. He wrote:“Meanwhile companies like us Make in India (and started making in Kerala recently too).”“Make in India is gaining momentum and we have to make up for several lost decades. Reflect on why they were ""lost decades"" and perhaps you will appreciate Make in India better,” he further added.Zoho has been expanding its operations across India, including in Kerala. The company has been focusing on establishing offices in smaller towns and non-metro areas as part of its broader strategy.The Make in India initiative, launched in 2014, aims to boost local manufacturing and reduce dependence on imports. Several companies, including Zoho, have increased their domestic production efforts as part of this initiative.Vembu’s response comes amid ongoing discussions on India's economic policies and industrial growth, with businesses and policymakers debating the impact of past and present strategies.Vembu recently drew a comparison between financial bubbles and flash floods, highlighting their long-term impact on economic structures. In a recent post, he discussed how capital inflows into a single sector can divert resources from others, weakening overall economic capabilities.Citing Silicon Valley as an example, Vembu pointed out the challenges faced by the semiconductor industry, attributing them to a talent shift toward sectors with higher financial incentives. ""There is a reason Intel needs help from TSMC now – for at least a generation, the smartest talent in Silicon Valley did not go into fabs,"" he wrote, adding that investors overlooked the sector due to the absence of large exits.Drawing a parallel to India, Vembu noted that the long-standing dominance of the IT industry resulted in the neglect of other critical sectors. ""The IT industry sucked all the oxygen for a long time, leading to impairment and neglect of capabilities in numerous other critical industries,"" he stated.He stressed the importance of addressing these gaps and rebuilding capabilities in affected sectors. ""We have to make up for lost time,"" he concluded.",Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu recently replied to an X post by Kerala Congress.

Air Canada and Thales issue joint statement

JetBlue, British Airways and Swiss Airlines have faced similar issues in the past

Air Canada has apologised after maps displayed on its in-flight entertainment systems reportedly erased Israel, replacing it with “Palestinian territories.” According to a report in CNN, Air Canada's Boeing 737 MAX fleet were found to have moving maps — part of the in flight entertainment (IFE) system — that did not show Israel as a state, but replaced it with the name "" Palestinian territories ."" The airline has deactivated the maps on 40 of its Boeing 737 MAX aircraft and is working to rectify the issue.The discrepancy, first noticed by a passenger, involved maps produced for French aerospace group Thales. Air Canada and Thales issued a joint statement acknowledging the error and stating that the issue has been ""resolved."" ""It was brought to the attention of Air Canada that the interactive map on its Boeing 737 fleet did not consistently portray certain Middle Eastern boundaries, including those of the State of Israel, at all amplification levels,"" the statement said. ""Air Canada’s policy in general is to display only city names on the maps in its aircraft, and the configuration on this particular system was not compliant with this policy."" Thales added in a separate statement that the map had been provided by a third party.The map feature was promptly disabled, and an updated version will be installed across the fleet starting March 14. Air Canada and Thales apologized for the ""unease created by this situation.""This is not the first time such an issue has occurred in aviation. JetBlue apologized for a similar map error in 2024, and British Airways faced a similar situation in 2013. In 2018, SWISS confirmed its policy of turning off maps entirely when landing in Tel Aviv after a similar incident.

Baidu has unveiled its AI model, Ernie X1, which is designed to articulate its reasoning process. The Ernie X1 model operates on similar principles to DeepSeek R1 , a model that garnered significant attention in Silicon Valley for its ability to deliver comparable performance to leading chatbots at a significantly lower development cost. Baidu emphasises that its reasoning model excels in areas such as daily dialogue, complex calculations, and logical deduction, as per a report.Bloomberg reports that in addition to the Ernie X1 launch, China's leading internet search provider has upgraded its flagship foundation model to Ernie 4.5 . Notably, the company has made all tiers of its AI service, including the X1 model, freely accessible to its chatbot users, accelerating its initial plans by several weeks.Baidu claims that Ernie 4.5 outperforms OpenAI's latest GPT 4.5 in text generation, citing various industry benchmarks. Baidu has also announced its intention to make its Ernie AI models open-source starting June 30. The company has also integrated the R1 model into its core search engine business.This launch appears to be a strategic move to regain momentum in the competitive AI landscape, where Baidu faces increasing pressure from emerging rivals such as DeepSeek, the report added.While Baidu was the first major Chinese tech company to introduce a ChatGPT-like chatbot, it has since faced stiff competition from rivals like TikTok parent company ByteDance and Moonshot AI. Furthermore, open-source models such as Alibaba's Qwen and DeepSeek have received recognition within the global developer community, the report added.The generative AI boom has positively impacted Baidu's financial performance, with a 26% increase in cloud revenue reported in its December-quarter results. This growth, driven by services provided to developers seeking computing power, was somewhat offset by weaker advertising sales amidst China's challenging economic conditions.","Baidu has unveiled its new Ernie X1 AI model, designed to articulate its reasoning process.

Facebook’s extreme measures in India

A ""low-ranking official,"" or as some say an office Babu at India's telecom regulator outsmarted Meta (then Facebook) CEO Mark Zuckerberg and some of the 'brightest tech minds' in his team with nothing more than a single click, according to explosive claims in a newly released memoir by former Facebook executive Sarah Wynn-Williams.The David versus Goliath moment allegedly occurred in 2016 during Facebook's aggressive push to save its controversial Free Basics program in India, which was facing regulatory scrutiny for potentially violating net neutrality principles.""Mark and some of the brightest tech minds in the world devoted months to this [outreach strategy], and some low-ranking official in India outfoxed them simply by clicking an opt-out box,"" Wynn-Williams writes in her book ""Careless People,"" which Meta is currently trying to block from publication.The memoir details how Facebook deployed its full arsenal of technological and political influence to sway public opinion about Free Basics. When India's Telecom Regulatory Authority (TRAI) opened public consultations on whether such programs should be banned, Facebook allegedly orchestrated an unprecedented pressure campaign.""Our policy team is directly engaged with the government, include Prime Minister Modi's office,"" Wynn-Williams quotes then-COO Sheryl Sandberg as writing in an internal email. ""We're lucky this is happening in a place where we have very deep senior relationships in the government, but it's still going to be hard.""According to the book, Facebook's strategy focused on creating ""the appearance of public support"" through automated emails. The social media giant allegedly turned on a ""megaphone that Mark wouldn't let Sheryl use for [promoting] organ donation"" to nudge Indian users into sending approximately 16 million supportive emails to TRAI.The jugaad – a Hindi term for an innovative, improvised solution – came when Facebook discovered their millions of automated emails weren't being counted. ""Someone at TRAI—whoever controlled the email address for the public comments — simply opted out of all emails from Facebook,"" writes Wynn-Williams.The book makes other startling claims about Facebook's operations in India, including that the company hired an ""ex-police captain"" who would ""go to jail in a clash between Facebook and the Indian government"" if executives were targeted in government raids.Meta has dismissed the book as containing ""out-of-date and previously reported claims"" and ""false accusations about our executives."" A spokesperson told The Hindu that ""Eight years ago, Sarah Wynn-Williams was fired for poor performance and toxic behaviour,"" claiming she ""has been paid by anti-Facebook activists.""Despite Meta's arbitration efforts to halt its publication and promotion in the US, ""Careless People"" remains available for purchase in India.

An adhd account trying to pathologize one of the best things a child can do to help with adhd (and also become an auto didact and knowledgeable person etc etc) is so dark.... I can't even begin”.

“I feel a huge percentage of adhd is screen addiction and dopaminergic burn out. I think the nature of this uninformed social media mental health subculture is rly a big concern. Some are great ofc but a lot of these seem like explicitly anti civilizational and geared towards making people worse.”

Grimes shares the hardest part of parenting

“Why is putting kids to bed arguably one of the hardest things to accomplish. I remember being a horror about going to bed too What is the evolutionary reason for this Am I missing something? Like the story can't be too good or they get turnt and wake up - meaning it has to be an exercise in bad art. I deeply resent having to spend so much time with bad art in order to bore children to sleep - something seems morally wrong here - and like conceptually wrong. Is there a way to not wake them up with cool ideas or art and still get them to sleep? Is this common issue? I know I tortured my parents with this same thing - like demanding more and more stories and taking like an hour or more to sleep and getting up if they tried to leave the room before I was asleep.”

Elon Musk’s ex-girlfriend and Canadian singer Grimes recently shared a post on X, revealing she has been diagnosed with autism this year. Stating that there’s a “subculture” of “mental healthy accounts” that are “extreme infohazards”, she wrote “Got diagnosed w adhd/ autism this year and realized I'm prob dyslexic which is why I can't spell at all without spellcheck - I feel like, had we known this when I was a child I would have worked so much less hard”. She further added “Not only can mental illnesses be contagious (in school when we were learning abt various mental illnesses me and a lot of other students noticed we would like start getting symptoms of them during those units - that wud go away once we finished)”.ADHD (Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder) is a neurodevelopmental condition marked by ongoing patterns of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity that are inconsistent with developmental expectations and interfere with daily functioning.Grimes further wrote:Stating that many are ‘self diagnosing’ the illness,Recently, Grimes opened up about facing parenting struggles on X.

Key Factors Influencing Potential Removal

Not everyone in the UK industry happy with DST

The UK government is reportedly weighing the reduction or elimination of its Digital Services Tax (DST) before April 2nd to mitigate potential trade tariffs from the US under President Donald Trump. Introduced in April 2020, the DST imposes a 2% levy on the gross revenues of digital companies operating search engines, social media platforms, and online marketplaces in the UK. According to a report in Bloomberg, the UK Treasury is exploring various options for modifying the tax, based on proposals from the Department for Business and Trade, according to sources familiar with the discussions. These potential changes do not include company-specific exemptions.The UK's Digital Services Tax or DST targets large digital companies generating substantial revenue from UK users. It taxes revenue, not profits, at a 2% rate. In its first year, the DST generated approximately £360 million from US tech giants like Amazon, Google, and Apple, often exceeding their UK corporation tax payments.The discussions follow US opposition to the tax during talks on a ""new economic deal"" between the US President Trump and the UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer. The levy, impacting companies like Google, Microsoft, Facebook, Instagram and Amazon, has been unpopular with the American companies.Starmer's government faces a dilemma: balancing the £800 million annual revenue from the DST against the risk of US tariffs. Additionally, there's concern about the perception of US influence over UK tax policy. Trump is reviewing US trading partners for ""reciprocal"" tariffs, potentially including various UK fiscal and regulatory policies.The UK's decision hinges on the severity of potential US tariffs and the degree to which modifying the DST would lessen their impact. The government is open to changes if the US offers a concrete tariff exemption, though discussions are in early stages.While some in the UK government view the DST as hindering economic growth and US trade relations, scrapping it could face opposition from Labour MPs. They are critical of welfare cuts and advocate for increased contributions from businesses and the wealthy.","The UK government is reportedly weighing the reduction or elimination of its Digital Services Tax (DST) The DST imposes a 2% levy on the gross revenues of digital companies operating search engines, social media platforms, and online marketplaces in the UK.

Global trade tensions to delay recovery

Indian IT has limited exposure, but

India's IT companies, already struggling this year, face a potentially prolonged recovery, with analysts suggesting fiscal 2026 may not bring the anticipated upturn, according to a report in Reuters. This pessimistic outlook follows Accenture's recent quarterly report, which highlighted persistent weakness in discretionary spending and overall demand. The Indian IT index has declined by 15.3% this year, on track for its worst quarter since June 2022, with major companies like TCS Infosys , and HCLTech experiencing losses ranging from 11.2% to 18.1%, Reuters reported.Accenture, a global IT services giant and a key indicator for the Indian IT industry, reported ""constrained"" discretionary project spending and a lack of significant client budget increases. Accenture CEO Julie Spellman Sweet attributed some of the slowdown to the Trump administration's ""Department of Government Efficiency"" initiatives. ""Federal represented approximately 8% of our global revenue and 16% of our Americas revenue in FY 2024. As you know, the new administration has a clear goal to run the federal government more efficiently. During this process, many new procurement actions have slowed, which is negatively impacting our sales and revenue,"" Sweet stated during a call with Wall Street analysts.The report also highlighted that escalating global trade tensions, driven by new U.S. tariffs, have heightened concerns about a slowdown in the United States, a critical market for Indian IT firms. ""Whatever has happened in the last two months has created a higher level of uncertainty in terms of how the first half of fiscal 2026 will pan out and what impact it will have on the FY26 recovery rate,"" Amit Chandra, deputy vice president at HDFC Securities, told Reuters.Kotak Institutional Equities analysts, as cited by Reuters report, predict that ""softening demand recovery and weak mega deal flow in fiscal 2025 will result in lower incremental revenue from mega deals in fiscal 2026 for Indian Tier-1 IT. Companies will also face net headwinds from early stages of gen AI adoption.""Chandra, quoted in the report, noted that while sectors like banking, financial services, and insurance (BFSI) and healthcare had shown signs of recovery, recent uncertainties have led clients across various sectors to adopt a ""wait-and-watch mode,"" potentially curtailing their spending.Citi Research, according to Reuters, estimates that IT companies within its coverage could see revenue growth of 4% in fiscal 2026, mirroring fiscal 2025.

What the FBI said about the scam



“The texts claim the recipient owes money for unpaid tolls and contain almost identical language. The ‘outstanding toll amount’ is similar. However, the link provided within the text is created to impersonate the state’s toll service name, and phone numbers appear to change between states.”

Chinese phishers are reportedly targeting US residents with text messages that appear to be from US toll road operators. These ""smishing"" texts are said to be targeting iPhone and Android users across America with fake toll bills . The FBI has advised users to delete these texts immediately. One cyber expert has also described the scale of this issue as ""astronomical."" According to a report by the Anti-Phishing Working Group (APWG), “residents of the US are being bombarded with text messages from Chinese phishers, purporting to come from US toll road operators , including the multi-state E-ZPass.” These kits also send package delivery and other fake messages. This is described as an infrastructural attack on phones. In December 2024, the FBI also advised Americans to stop sending texts due to Chinese hackers.In a statement to Forbes, the FBI said:Attackers are reportedly registering tens of thousands of domains to impersonate state and city toll agencies, using an advanced phishing kit from China to send nearly identical scam texts.These messages, often sent to random phone numbers regardless of toll usage, usually include links with Chinese top-level domains like .TOP, .CYOU, and .XIN—the .TOP domain in particular has a history of abuse and remains under ICANN investigation.Despite available anti-spam measures on SMS and RCS protocols, scammers continually change tactics, making prevention difficult. Users are urged to report these scams to help improve global blocking mechanisms and to verify toll charges only through official sources while taking precautions such as changing passwords if they click on any suspicious links.","Chinese phishers are reportedly targeting US residents with text messages that appear to be from US toll road operators.

Demonstrations and vandalism have erupted, causing a decline in Tesla's sales and heightened backlash following Musk's controversial gesture at Donald Trump’s inauguration.

Why rise in Tesla cars trade-ins

Why protests against Tesla

Elon Musk addresses Tesla employees

A record number of Tesla vehicles have been traded in this month as protests grow against CEO Elon Musk ’s involvement with the Trump administration and the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). According to data from Edmunds, Tesla cars from 2017 and newer made up 1.4% of all vehicles traded in until March 15. This is a sharp increase from 0.4% during the same period last year. Analysts at Edmunds believe this number could rise further in the coming weeks.The surge in trade-ins comes as activists across the U.S. stage demonstrations known as ""Tesla Takedown"" to protest Musk’s role in cutting federal jobs and canceling contracts that fund global humanitarian programs. Social media has been flooded with posts from Tesla owners giving up their vehicles in anger. In some cases, protesters have set Tesla cars on fire and vandalized showrooms and charging stations.The EV company has already seen a significant drop in sales across Europe, with some countries reporting declines of over 40%. Tesla’s highly anticipated Cybertruck is also struggling, with sales falling short of company projections. In addition, Tesla recently had to recall 46,096 Cybertruck vehicles due to safety concerns.People are protesting against Tesla due to Elon Musk’s involvement in DOGE and his growing political ties. Demonstrations have erupted across countries, with Tesla owners distancing themselves from Musk. Several demonstrators have been arrested outside a Tesla dealership in New York City, chanting, “We need clean air, not another billionaire.”The backlash intensified after Musk made a controversial gesture at Donald Trump’s inauguration, which some interpreted as a Nazi salute. The incident divided Tesla’s community, leaving many torn between their love for the cars and frustration with Musk.Elon Musk recently addressed Tesla employees in an all-hands meeting commending their efforts, highlighting achievements like the rollout of over 7 million vehicles worldwide. While acknowledging the recent stock dive and challenges, Musk emphasized Tesla's promising future, urging shareholders to hold their shares. He also discussed Tesla's wins with the Dojo supercomputer, Supercharger network, and robot advancements.“Tesla is home to some of the world's best talent, crafting and building our remarkable products. Your hard work is paying off -- great job, everyone,” Musk highlighted.","A record number of Tesla vehicles have been traded in this month as protests grow against CEO Elon Musk ’s involvement with the Trump administration and the Department of Government Efficiency.
