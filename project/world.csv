Canadian visitors to decline

Recent policy decisions by US President Donald Trump are raising concerns about the future of American tourism, with fears that price increases and a stronger dollar could deter foreign visitors.A report by Tourism Economics, a division of Oxford Economics, estimates that the US tourism sector could lose approximately $64 billion in 2025 due to reduced international and domestic travel.The report forecasts a 5.1 per cent drop in foreign arrivals to the United States in 2025 compared to the previous year, a sharp reversal from earlier projections of an 8.8 per cent increase, according to the report published late late month. Visitor expenditure is also expected to decline by 10.9 per cent ""which totals to an estimated $18B loss in 2025 alone,"" according to the report.Since the report was published ""The situation has deteriorated further"", said Tourism Economics president Adam Sacks, citing growing negative sentiment toward the US He attributed this to the Trump administration's recent actions, including tariffs on Canada, Mexico, China, and potential measures against the European Union, as well as stricter immigration policies.Other significant policy changes include cuts to the US Agency for International Development, civil service redundancies, and controversial strategies regarding the Ukraine and Gaza conflicts. These moves, combined with polarizing rhetoric, are expected to discourage international travel and deter organizations from hosting events in the US, according to Tthe ourism Economics.The World Tourism Forum Institute also warned that strict immigration rules, a strong dollar, and rising global tensions could have long-term impacts on US tourism patterns.A December YouGov survey of 16 European and Asian nations found that 35 percent of respondents were less inclined to visit the United States under Trump's leadership, while 22 percent expressed increased interest.Despite the projected decline, some tourists remain undeterred. In Times Square, AFP interviewed visitors from France, Uzbekistan, and Argentina, who said Trump's policies had not changed their travel plans.Marianela Lopez and Ailen Hadjikovakis, both 33 and from Argentina, chose to enter the U.S. using their European passports. ""We were a bit scared about the situation, but we didn't change our plans,"" Lopez said.The Lagardere family from France also maintained their original travel plans. Laurent Lagardere, 54, remarked, ""The Americans elected this president. It's democracy. If they're not happy, they'll change it in four years.""The National Travel and Tourism Office projected 77.7 million foreign visitors in 2024, reflecting a 17 percent annual increase. However, some key markets are already showing signs of decline.Western European visitors, who accounted for 37 per cent of 2024 arrivals, along with Canadians and Mexicans, are reportedly the most likely to seek alternative destinations, as reported by AFP.Statistics Canada reported a 23 per cent year-on-year decrease in US-returning Canadian travelers in February, marking two consecutive months of decline. NYC Tourism president Julie Coker noted that New York City, which welcomed 12.9 million international visitors in 2024, is experiencing increased Canadian cancellations and reduced online searches.Meanwhile, British and German authorities have issued heightened travel document warnings due to the risk of arrest when visiting the US.The impact is also being felt by airlines. United Airlines and its competitors report a notable reduction in both Canadian-US travel and domestic demand.Industry professionals worry these trends could affect major upcoming sporting events, including the 2025 Ryder Cup, the 2026 FIFA World Cup, and the 2026 Los Angeles Olympics.","A report by Tourism Economics estimates that the US tourism sector could lose approximately $64 billion in 2025.

TORONTO: New Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney will run in an Ottawa area district as he seeks to join Parliament for the first time, two officials familiar with the matter said Saturday, a day before Carney triggers an early general election before a vote on April 28.The election will take place against the backdrop of a trade war and sovereignty threats from U.S. President Donald Trump.The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity as they were not authorized to speak publicly, said Carney will run to represent the suburban Ottawa area of Nepean.The election campaign for 343 seats or districts in the House of Commons will last 37 days.The party that commands a majority in the House of Commons, either alone or with the support of another party, will form the next government and its leader will be prime minister.Carney replaced Justin Trudeau, who announced his resignation in January, but remained in power until the Liberal Party elected a new leader on March 9 following a leadership race by the governing party.Carney, sworn in as Canada's 24th prime minister on March 14, has said the government in a time of crisis needs a strong and clear mandate.The governing Liberals had appeared poised for a historic election defeat this year until Trump declared a trade war. Trump has repeatedly said that Canada should become the 51st U.S. state and he acknowledged Friday that he has upended Canadian politics.What Trump hasn't said is that the almost daily attacks on Canada's sovereignty have infuriated Canadians. That has led to a surge in Canadian nationalism that has bolstered Liberal poll numbers.The opposition Conservatives hoped to make the election about Trudeau, whose popularity declined as food and housing prices rose and immigration surged. But after decades of bilateral stability, the vote is now is expected to focus on who is best equipped to deal with Trump.Trump put 25% tariffs on Canada's steel and aluminum and is threatening sweeping tariffs on all Canadian products - as well as all of America's trading partners - on April 2.Carney still hasn't had a phone call with Trump and that might not happen now until after the election. Trump mocked Trudeau by calling him governor, but he has not yet mentioned Carney's name.Carney, 60, was the head of the Bank of Canada during the 2008 financial crisis. In 2013, he became the first noncitizen of the United Kingdom to run the Bank of England - helping to manage the impact of Brexit.Pierre Poilievre, the leader of the Conservatives, is Carney's main challenger. The party and Poilievre were heading for a huge victory in Canada's federal election this year until Trump's near-daily trade and annexation threats derailed them.Poilievre, 45, for years the party's go-to attack dog, is a career politician and firebrand populist who says he will put ""Canada first."" He attacks the mainstream media and vows to defund Canada's public broadcaster. His party announced that it won't allow media onboard his campaign buses and planes.",New Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney will run in an Ottawa area district as he seeks to join Parliament for the first time.

Errol Musk , father of billionaire Elon Musk , recently defended his son against accusations of racism by highlighting the family's relationship with Black domestic staff during apartheid-era South Africa.Speaking to The Washington Post, the 79-year-old claimed his children were uninterested in ""political nonsense"" despite being raised under a system of racial segregation. ""We had several black servants who were their friends,"" Errol Musk told the newspaper, in response to questions about Elon Musk's opposition to workplace diversity and equity programs.The elder Musk portrayed South Africa during his children's upbringing as a ""well-run, law-abiding country with virtually no crime at all.""Errol Musk also acknowledged importing emeralds from an unregistered Zambian mine during the apartheid era, telling The Washington Post that the operation ""helped me and my two boys sustain ourselves during the collapse of Apartheid"" in South Africa. While Elon Musk initially referenced the family's involvement with the mine in a 2014 interview, he later sought to distance himself from it. In a 2021 tweet, he denied the mine's existence, claiming he arrived in Canada in 1989 with only $2,500 Canadian dollars, took on $100,000 in student debt, and independently built his first business using his personal computer.Biographer Walter Isaacson and reporting from Business Insider claimed that Errol Musk did not own the mine but did profit from emerald imports. Errol justified the use of an unregistered mine by saying, ""you would wind up with nothing because the Blacks would take everything from you,"" according to Isaacson.Critics argue that Musk's privileged background shielded him from the realities of apartheid. Rudolph Pienaar, a former schoolmate, described Elon's childhood as a ""bubble of entitlement,"" telling The Washington Post, ""I am not sure if Elon can conceive of systematic discrimination and struggle because that's not his experience. His life now in some ways is how it was under apartheid—rich and entitled with the entire society built to sustain him and his ilk.""Elon Musk's public image has faced further scrutiny since his 2022 acquisition of Twitter (now X), particularly as the platform's policy changes have allowed the spread of extremist content. NBC News alleged that verified accounts on X were able to share pro-Nazi material, including Adolf Hitler's speeches. Musk's right-wing associations have drawn increasing attention, particularly after he was seen making a gesture during Donald Trump 's second-term inauguration that some interpreted as a ""Nazi"" salute—though his supporters argued it was a ""Roman"" salute. Musk dismissed these accusations on X with a post that included wordplay referencing Nazi officials' names.Musk is facing accusations of hostility toward diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives, calling them the ""woke mind virus."" His recent criticism of DEI job listings in the UK's NHS sparked backlash and raised concerns among US educators.At the World Governments Summit in Dubai, Musk urged the US to ""delete entire agencies"" under President Trump to cut spending and reshape government priorities, arguing that merely scaling back would allow them to regrow.Musk’s influence in Washington is growing, particularly within the Department of Government Efficiency, where he has reportedly sidelined career officials and gained access to sensitive federal data. He also supports Trump’s isolationist foreign policy, questioning agencies like USAID.Musk further stirred controversy by linking DEI to artificial intelligence, suggesting AI focused on ""diversity at all costs"" could eliminate men in power. Meanwhile, he announced new projects, including X’s AI chatbot Grok 3 and a ""Dubai Loop"" transportation system.",Errol Musk defended his son against accusations of racism by highlighting the family's relationship with Black domestic staff during apartheid-era South Africa.

UK issues new travel advice for citizens going to US

Though Canada has not issued any travel advisory against visiting the United States, Canadian lawmaker Charlie Angus issued a warning against travelling to the US as he claimed that Canadian citizens are being kidnapped by ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) agents. ""We have seen too many stories of citizens being pulled out of airport lines, and being fingerprinted and deported, as if they were criminals. Citizens being kidnapped to illegal detention by ICE…this is not the actions of a Democratic nation,"" New Democratic Party's leader said. While Canada and US have locked horns in a tariff war, the travel warning coincides with the Trump administration's border crackdown.""Canada will never kiss that gangster's ring. We are truth, we are north, we are strong, we are free, we will not bend, and we will not give an inch,"" Angus said in a press conference.Canadian actor Jasmine Mooney who starred in an American Pie video said she was put in chains when she went to renew her visa at the San Ysidro border crossing. She said she was told that she was in the wrong place and that she should have gone to a US consulate. After some to and fro, she was put into ICE custody as she failed to explain to the officers that she was not trying to enter the US illegally. After 12 days of detention, she was finally released and allowed to fly back to Canada.In a massive crackdown on illegal immigrants, the Trump administration has been on an arrest spree. The arrest of two green card holders, Mahmoud Khalil and Badar Khan Suri, created ripples as the administration is planning to deport them.

TOI Correspondent from Washington:

A federal judge on Thursday blocked the Trump administration's effort to deport Badar Khan Suri , an Indian post-doc fellow at Georgetown University who has been detained by immigration authorities for alleged pro-Hamas activism, saying he should not removed from the US pending the outcome of the legal challenge seeking his release.Virginia Eastern District Judge Patricia Tolliver Giles did not rule on the merits of the deportation case itself but suggested Suri's habeas corpus needs to be heard first in an order stating he ""shall not be removed from the U.S unless and until the Court issues a contrary order.""Suri's attorney has said his client was abducted from his apartment in Rosslyn, Virginia, a suburb outside Washington DC, and is incarcerated in distant Louisiana, where the Syria-born Palestinian activist Mahmoud Khalil has also been imprisoned at a different facility.Khalil's attorneys too are fighting his deportation, and after accusing authorities of moving their client to a more conservative jurisdiction (Louisiana is a deep red Republican state), they got the case transferred to New Jersey.The detentions follow a Trump crackdown on liberal campuses where student activists have been protesting and criticizing -- both directly and on social media -- U.S foreign policy with regards to the Israel-Palestinian issue.The Trump administration says foreign students, even if they have Green cards and valid visas, are violating terms of their stay with political activism that pose a threat to US national security. Administration officials have warned that many more foreign student activists will be identified and deported.Free speech advocates maintain the administration's actions are a violation of the First Amendment, even with regards to foreign scholars, with some recalling campus anti-Vietnam war protests in the 1960s. “Badar Khan Suri’s detention is a clear violation of his constitutional rights, and he must be released,” Virginia Democrat lawmaker Don Beyer said Thursday, adding, “The ‘justification’ given for these violations of Mr. Suri’s right to due process is another violation of the Constitution: a blatant attack on the First Amendment.""The judicial interventions that are stalling the deportations has enraged President Trump, who says lawyers ""endlessly search"" for "" radical left judges "" to thwart the administration's effort to deport dangerous illegal immigrants, although the crackdown now targets even legal residents.According to a rough count by legal mavens, Out of 679 active federal district court judges, 384 were appointed by Democratic presidents, and 257 appointed by Republican presidents. In the Appeals Court, out of 179 active judges, 88 were appointed by Democratic presidents, and 89 were appointed by Republican presidents. Six of the nine Supreme Court judges have been appointed by Republican Presidents, including three by Trump.But the US President and his acolytes, including Elon Musk, are still unhappy and want Roberts to sign off on moves to impeach liberal justices balking at an imperial presidency they are aiming for, where the President's authority is unquestioned. Roberts, who has suggested the administration can go through with the appeals process rather than target the judges.In a series of posts, Trump raged that ""Unlawful Nationwide Injunctions by Radical Left Judges could very well lead to the destruction of our Country!""""These people are Lunatics, who do not care, even a little bit, about the repercussions from their very dangerous and incorrect Decisions and Rulings,"" Trump fumed, adding that ""No District Court Judge, or any Judge, can assume the duties of the President of the United States. Only Crime and Chaos would result.""Judges are now being openly identified as ""Obama judges"" ""Biden judges"" ""Bush judges"" etc depending on who and in what year they were appointed.

Q: What impact has the education department had on student performance?

Q: Is the public in favor of closing the department?

Q: Who supports Trump’s move?

Q: What’s next?

Trump, surrounded by schoolchildren seated at desks arranged in the White House's East Room, smiled as he held up the signed order during a special ceremony.Since its founding in 1979, the department of education (DoE) has played a pivotal role in administering student loans, supporting students with disabilities and low-income families, and enforcing civil rights in schools. Trump’s action, framed as a bid to return power to the states, reflects long-standing conservative frustration with what they view as federal overreach in education.While Trump cannot legally abolish the department without Congressional approval, the executive order signals his administration’s intent to cripple it through staff reductions and budget cuts. Backed by tech tycoon Elon Musk’s department for government efficiency (DOGE), the effort has already seen nearly half of the DoE’s workforce laid off. The move has thrilled conservative groups like Moms for Liberty but sparked outrage among educators, civil rights advocates, and Democratic lawmakers who warn that it could undermine protections and funding for millions of vulnerable students.Here is all you need to knowA: The order directs education secretary Linda McMahon to “take all necessary steps to facilitate the closure of the department of education and return education authority to the states.” While it does not immediately abolish the department—Congress must approve that—it does instruct the administration to scale back operations and staffing.A: Trump argued, “We're going to return education back to the states where it belongs,” calling the federal department unnecessary. He also cited falling test scores and high spending as reasons, saying, “It’s doing us no good.” He believes states can run education systems more efficiently, comparing his goal to countries like “Norway, Denmark, [and] Finland.”A: No. Abolishing a federal agency like the DoE requires an act of Congress. Trump currently lacks the necessary majority to pass such a law. However, he can significantly weaken the department through budget cuts, workforce reductions, and administrative changes.According to White House press Secretary Karoline Leavitt, “The department of education will be much smaller than it is today.” Some “critical functions”—like Pell Grants, student loans, and funding for students with disabilities—are expected to remain. Trump himself said these “useful functions… will be fully preserved.”A: Low-income students, students with disabilities, and students in rural or underfunded districts stand to lose the most. Programs like Title I and the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act depend on federal oversight and funding. As Katie Paris of Red Wine and Blue said, “There’s a real opportunity people are going to learn how essential the education department is to access public schools if it’s gone.”A: About 13% of funding for K-12 schools comes from the federal government; the rest is state and locally funded. But that 13% is vital, especially in states that rely heavily on federal dollars—like Mississippi, South Dakota, Montana, and Arkansas.A: Not entirely. Trump claims US students rank “at the bottom of the list,” but data shows otherwise. According to the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA), US students are “above average in reading and close to average in math.” Nat Malkus of the conservative American Enterprise Institute added, “The US ranks in the middle of the pack on most international assessments.”A: The department’s critics claim it hasn’t closed achievement gaps. But national data shows that since its founding, fourth-grade math scores have increased by 24 points, and reading scores have held steady. Fernando Reimers of Harvard noted, “In the US only 4 percent of total federal spending is devoted to education,” far less than in many peer countries.A: No. A Reuters/Ipsos poll found that 65% of Americans oppose shuttering the department, with only 30% in support. Democratic pollster John Anzalone argued, “Education is generally popular with voters,” suggesting this could backfire on Trump politically.A: Conservative advocacy groups like Moms for Liberty and the Heritage Foundation strongly back the decision. “It’s a beautiful day to dismantle the Department of Education,” the Heritage Foundation said on X. Moms for Liberty co-founder Tina Descovich added, “I'm very happy about that,” in reference to department cuts.A: Several lawsuits have already been filed. Senator Patty Murray said, “Donald Trump knows perfectly well he can’t abolish the department of education without Congress.” A previous attempt to dismantle the US Agency for International Development was blocked by a federal judge for likely violating the Constitution.While the executive order sets the process in motion, full closure of the department will face Congressional scrutiny, potential legal battles, and continued public debate.

'They did bad things': Donald Trump orders crackdown on law firms who challenged him,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/they-did-bad-things-donald-trump-orders-crackdown-on-law-firms-who-challenged-him/articleshow/119361813.cms,".





Trump Responds To Claims That His Actions Towards Law Firms Are ‘Coercion’: They ‘Did Bad Things’

US president Donald Trump has ordered Attorney General Pam Bondi to review the actions of lawyers and law firms that his administration believes filed frivolous lawsuits or attempted to block immigration policies.In the Friday-night memo first reported by CNN, Trump accused some legal professionals of engaging in ""frivolous, unreasonable, and vexatious litigation"" against the government. The directive asks Bondi to review lawsuits filed in the past eight years and recommend possible actions against attorneys found to have acted improperly. This could include revoking security clearances, cancelling federal contracts, or other penalties.The memo's vague language leaves it unclear what specific actions would warrant punishment. However, it explicitly calls for misconduct complaints against lawyers working on immigration-related cases.Trump has long expressed frustration with legal opposition to his policies, particularly regarding immigration. His administration has faced numerous legal challenges over travel bans, asylum restrictions, and border enforcement measures. This latest move is seen as an attempt to deter further lawsuits.“Far too many attorneys and law firms have long ignored these requirements when litigating against the Federal Government or in pursuing baseless partisan attacks,” Trump said in the presidential memorandum released by the White House on Saturday.During Friday's Oval Office meeting, president Trump responded to questions about his actions towards law firms. ""They went after me for years ruthlessly, violently, illegally. They are not babies. They are very sophisticated people. They did bad things. They went after me for years.""The White House defended the decision in a post on X, saying, ""In everything we do, we're restoring law, restoring order, and restoring public safety in America... and bringing honour, integrity, and accountability back to the highest levels of government.""Trump’s actions against the legal community seem to have led at least one major law firm to make concessions this week. According to New York Post, Paul Weiss, a prominent law firm known for working with Democratic clients, agreed to provide $40 million in pro bono legal services to the Trump administration. This decision was made to bypass an executive order that would have restricted the firm from representing clients before the federal government.","US president Donald Trump has ordered Attorney General Pam Bondi to review the actions of lawyers and law firms.

Do foreigners have free speech rights in the United States?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/do-foreigners-have-free-speech-rights-in-the-united-states/articleshow/119360286.cms,"Two Indian scholars are among those targeted by Trump administration for what it calls 'support' for Hamas. In India, foreigners don't enjoy constitutional protection of freedom of speech. But the situation is more complex in America , because of its First Amendment. Here's a short explainer on the legal ambiguity

Ranjini Srinivasan and Badar Khan Suri have been at the receiving end of America’s new deportation policy targeting those seen to be sympathising with the Palestinian group Hamas. The latter is banned as a terrorist organisation by US, and the Trump administration has been clear that foreign scholars in the American university system found supporting Hamas will have their visas revoked and deported. But can merely expressing a political opinion attract deportation proceedings? Does freedom of speech only apply to citizens? What does Indian law say in similar context? Here’s a breakdown of the legal nuances: What’s the Indian legal view?Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution of India provides for the fundamental right to freedom of speech and expression. The article begins with ‘All citizens shall have the right... to freedom of speech and expression’. Therefore, the position in India about applicability of this right is unambiguous and applies only to citizens, not foreigners. What about the US First Amendment? Are foreigners in US with legal visas covered?US Constitution states that ‘Congress shall make no law... abridging the freedom of speech’. Moreover, the constitution makers in US spoke about ‘the people’, which could be extended to any person who is validly within the territory of the country, a throwback to America’s founding. Thus, given that the First Amendment essentially is a restriction on Congress, from plain reading it applies even when Congress is making a law governing non-citizens of the country with valid visas. One can also argue that this applies to illegal immigrants. In fact, on this basis, institutions like Columbia University’s Knight First Amendment Institute have called Trump’s deportation of students partaking in political pro-Palestine speeches, as illegal and unconstitutional.What is Trump’s position? However, the current US administration is likely to take the defence of the interplay of US constitution with other existing statutes that regulate the activities of non-citizens. In the past, similar ploys have been used by other presidents to stifle political opposition. These are some examples.Alien Enemies Act 1798 was introduced by president John Adams to restrain political debate, convicting multiple non-citizens, which were later overturned when president Jefferson came to power. During the 1950s at the height of the anti-communism wave in US, Congress passed laws banning the Communist Party and allowing the deportation of noncitizen members. Robert Galvan, a longtime US resident, faced deportation for past Communist Party membership before the laws were enacted. The US Supreme Court upheld his deportation, though Justice Hugo Black dissented, arguing it was unfair to punish Galvan for past actions which were legal.In Reno v. American Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee, US govt sought to deport eight legal US residents for their involvement in a Palestinian liberation group. The group argued they were being selectively targeted for their political views, but the US govt shifted to immigration law violations instead. The Supreme Court, with Justice Scalia writing the majority opinion, ruled that non-citizens unlawfully in US cannot use selective enforcement as a defence against deportation. However, the question of rights of lawful non-citizens was per se not touched upon.So, there is no clear-cut answer whether the First Amendment protects non-citizens. US Constitution allows for interpretation, particularly regarding undocumented immigrants, and the Supreme Court has yet to make a definitive ruling. Additionally, the First Amendment does not specify whether “the people” entitled to freedoms like speech, religion, and assembly refers strictly to citizens or includes a wider group, such as visitors, students, and workers in the US.","In India, foreigners don't enjoy constitutional protection of freedom of speech.

'Revoking parole status to expedite deportation'

WASHINGTON: US President Donald Trump's administration will revoke the temporary legal status of 530,000 Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans and Venezuelans in the country, according to a Federal Register notice on Friday, the latest expansion of his crackdown on immigration.The move, effective April 24, cuts short a two-year ""parole"" granted to the migrants under former President Joe Biden that allowed them to enter the country by air if they had US sponsors. Trump, a Republican, took steps to ramp up immigration enforcement after taking office, including a push to deport record numbers of migrants in the US illegally. ReutersHe has argued that the legal entry parole programmes launched under his Democratic predecessor overstepped the boundaries of federal law and called for their termination in a Jan 20 executive order.Trump said on March 6 that he would decide ""very soon"" whether to strip the parole status from some 240,000 Ukrainians who fled to the US during the conflict with Russia. The remarks came in response to a report that said his administration planned to revoke the status for Ukrainians as soon as April.Biden launched a parole entry programme for Venezuelans in 2022 and expanded it to Cubans, Haitians and Nicaraguans in 2023 as his administration grappled with high levels of illegal immigration from those nationalities. Diplomatic and political relations between the four countries and the US have been strained.The new legal pathways came as Biden tried to clamp down on illegal crossings at the US-Mexico border. The Trump administration's decision to strip the legal status from half a million migrants could make many vulnerable to deportation if they choose to remain in the US. It remains unclear how many who entered the US on parole now have another form of protection.In a notice set to formally publish in the Federal Register on Monday, the US department of homeland security said revoking the parole status would make it easier to place the migrants in a fast-track deportation process called ""expedited removal"".Under a Trump-era policy implemented in Jan, expedited removal can be applied to certain migrants in the US for two years or less.","The move, effective April 24, cuts short a two-year ""parole"" granted to the migrants under former President Joe Biden.

Canada's travel advisory for China



Canada has now updated its travel advisories for the United States and China in the backdrop of the ongoing tariff war with the US and after China executed four Canadians in recent weeks. The update said Canadians who are staying in the United States for more than 30 days should make sure that they are registered. This comes as the Donald Trump administration made the registration mandatory. Earlier, Canadians did not need any visa or registration to travel to the US.“Canadians and other foreign nationals visiting the United States for periods longer than 30 days must be registered with the United States Government,” the latest travel advisory to the United States said. “Failure to comply with the registration requirement could result in penalties, fines, and misdemeanor prosecution.”Visitors can consult the US Citizenship and Immigration Services website to check if they need to register and how to do so, the advisor said. Travelers can see if they have been automatically registered on entry to the US by looking at their I-94 admission form on the US CBP website, the advisory said.Apart from the US, Canada updated its travel advisory to China as well after foreign affairs minister Melanie Joy said earlier this week that China executed four Canadians in recent months. The updated advisory warned Canadians to exercise a ""high degree of caution"" in China -- especially those with dual citizenship who may be denied access to Canadian consular services if they entered the country on a Chinese passport.“Our ability to provide consular assistance in China is limited due to the level of transparency in China’s judicial system,” the advisory said. “It may also impact your ability to obtain effective legal assistance.”The Canadian travel advisory to China also warned that non-violent acts such as financial crimes may incur “severe punishment” in the country. It adds that travellers may also face an exit ban if they are linked to people “in any open civil or criminal investigations, including business disputes.”","Canada has updated its travel advisories for the US and China.

A huge repatriation drive

Growing worries about deportations

Calls for international help

Zahra Mousavi, a women's rights activist, fled from Afghanistan to neighboring Pakistan in March 2022 after months of fighting and protesting the oppressive Taliban regime She now lives in hiding and constant fear of being apprehended by the Pakistani police and deported to her home country.Mousavi actively participated in street protests against the Taliban regime after the Islamic fundamentalist group seized power in the war-ravaged country in August 2021.She advocated for women's rights by taking part in public gatherings and demonstrations, and tried to make the voices of Afghan women heard in the rest of the world.But with the Taliban slapping broad restrictions on women and girls and gradually squeezing them out of public life, Mousavi was forced to leave.In Pakistan, however, she has struggled to secure the necessary documents to stay in the country.""I could not obtain a valid Pakistani visa for myself and my family due to high costs and Pakistan's strict visa policies,"" the 29-year-old told DW.""This led to my arrest by Pakistani police on February 22. They entered my home in plain clothes, conducted an intense search, and arrested both me and my young daughter, taking us to a deportation detention camp,"" she said.""We were kept there in extremely harsh conditions for two days and one night, and we were only released after providing guarantees and due to the pressure of human rights activists.""DW spoke to several other Afghan female activists, who are also living in hiding as Islamabad looks to accelerate deportations to Afghanistan.Jamila Ahmadi, 27, said many of her fellow Afghan women had already been sent back to Afghanistan and warned that their lives, as well as hers, were in danger.""My activism, especially my efforts toward women's capacity-building before the Taliban takeover, my reporting on Taliban crimes, and my involvement with the National Directorate of Security (NDS), has placed me in significant danger,"" Ahmadi said.""If I am compelled to return to Taliban rule, it would clearly be a certain death.""Many women's rights activists only sought asylum in Pakistan when the situation became untenable in Taliban-ruled Afghanistan.""In February 2021, I was attacked, resulting in a broken leg, but my determination remained unshaken,"" said Ahmadi.""Again, in September 2021, we were brutally beaten by the Taliban.""Pakistan has hosted millions of Afghan refugees for decades.But over the last three years, Pakistan's relationship with Afghanistan has deteriorated.Islamabad is angry with the Taliban authorities over the operations of the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), a militant group that formed in 2007 and has conducted numerous attacks on Pakistani security forces.As cross-border tensions escalate, concerns about the well-being of Afghans in Pakistan have increased.Islamabad is currently carrying out a huge drive to repatriate the roughly 4 million Afghans who have crossed the border in the past four decades.Pakistan already repatriated more than 800,000 Afghan refugees between September 2023 and the end of last year, according to the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR).Legal experts and refugee rights activists have criticized the Pakistani government's deportation plans, particularly when it comes to deporting Afghan women's rights activists .""Sending activists back to Afghanistan, where they are very likely to be subjected to torture at the hands of the Taliban regime, would put them in greater risk,"" Osama Malik, a refugee lawyer in Islamabad, told DW.Ahmadi said her health had been affected by the deportation drive.""Unfortunately, for more than a month, the Pakistani police have made life difficult for refugees, including issues with visas and visa extensions. My visa expired on February 25, 2025. My personal, psychological and emotional problems are due to not having a visa and being unable to extend it,"" she said.While rights groups have accused the Pakistani authorities of harassing Afghan refugees, Islamabad has denied the allegations and stressed that the removals were part of a 2023 campaign called the ""Illegal Foreigners Repatriation Plan.""There ""is no specific category for activists among those being deported,"" a Pakistani official, who asked not to be named, told DW. ""The responsibility of hosting Afghan refugees should not fall solely on Pakistan, as other countries can also accommodate them,"" the official added.Qaiser Khan Afridi, spokesperson for the UNHCR in Pakistan, said the agency was worried about the deportations.""UNHCR is especially concerned for Afghans who face a risk of harm upon return, such as ethnic and religious minorities, single women, journalists, human rights activists, and members of artistic professions like musicians.""""In view of these mounting challenges, UNHCR urged Pakistan to continue to provide safety to Afghans at risk, irrespective of their documentation status,"" said Afridi.Maria Noori, a 34-year-old activist from Kabul facing deportation, called on the international community to intervene and save the lives of Afghan female activists living in fear in Pakistan.""Being sent back to Afghanistan would mean facing torture, imprisonment, or even death. The international community must understand that deporting human rights activists, particularly women, is a direct threat to our lives, and immediate action is needed to protect us,"" she told DW.The lawyer Malik criticized Western governments for their inaction.""It is unfortunate that none of the Western countries have stepped up to immediately allow these female activists to travel to their countries,"" he said.Noori explained that the lack of a legal status and residency documents poses a big challenge. ""Additionally, we face harsh economic conditions, unemployment, lack of access to health care and education, and security threats from extremists.",Afghan women's rights activist Zahra Mousavi fled Afghanistan to Pakistan in March 2022.

While the raid successfully led to the detention of more than two dozen individuals, including foreign nationals, it quickly descended into disorder as locals swarmed the premises to seize valuables, as reported by the local Pakistani newspaper The Nation. Laptops, monitors, keyboards, and other electronic equipment intended for investigative purposes were instead carried away by opportunistic looters.Videos circulating on social media captured scenes of individuals, young and old, forcing their way into the building and openly making off with electronic devices. A large crowd gathered outside, and despite the presence of law enforcement, the looting continued unabated. Eyewitnesses reported that FIA officials struggled to control the situation, allowing the ransacking to proceed unchecked. Amid the chaos, some foreigners linked to the scamming operation reportedly escaped.Sources within the FIA, quoted by The Nation, indicated that the agency had been aware of the call center's illegal activities for some time but delayed action while awaiting approval from senior authorities. The center was allegedly involved in defrauding individuals across multiple countries, using Pakistani employees to execute scams and extort money.The individuals detained during the raid were transferred to the FIA office for further questioning. However, the agency has remained tight-lipped about the broader investigation, declining to provide additional details despite repeated inquiries. The FIA now faces criticism for its handling of the operation and its failure to prevent the looting during what was meant to be a major crackdown on international cybercrime.","Chaos erupted in Islamabad's Sector F-11 after a raid by Pakistan's Federal Investigation Agency spiraled into an unexpected spree of looting.

A key operative of LeT, he was involved in planning and executing multiple attacks in Jammu and Kashmir.

He was also known as Faisal Nadeem .

Qatal had strong ties with Hafiz Saeed , the mastermind behind the 26/11 Mumbai terror attacks.

His terror activities date back to 2002-03 when he infiltrated India and operated in the Poonch-Rajouri region.

He founded terror outfits like People’s Anti-Fascist Force (PAFF) and The Resistant Force (TRF) to hide LeT and Jaish-e-Mohammed’s (JeM) activities.

At least two Pakistsoldiers and nine terrorists were killed after the Pak security forces raided two hideouts used by an armed group in the restive northwest, triggering gun battles, Al Jazeera reported.The raids were conducted on Saturday in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa's Mohmand and Dera Ismail Khan districts, which border Afghanistan.According to local police, the fighters belonged to Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), also known as the Pakistani Taliban.Notably, TTP -- banned in Pakistan -- is a separate group but an ally of the Afghan Taliban, who reseized power in neighbouring Afghanistan in August 2021 as the United States and other NATO troops were in the final stages of a withdrawal from the country after 20 years of war.Many TTP leaders and fighters have found sanctuaries and have even been living openly in Afghanistan since the Taliban takeover, which also emboldened the Pakistani Taliban, according to Al Jazeera.In a separate incident on Saturday, fighters ambushed security forces in northwestern Pakistan's Kurram district, bordering Afghanistan, the report said, citing local police. Authorities have yet to confirm any casualties in that attack.Pakistan's military is engaged in an ongoing operation in Kurram, an area that has witnessed years of violence between Sunni and Shia Muslim communities, as reported by Al Jazeera. Hundreds of people have been killed in fighting between armed groups, exacerbating tensions in the region.Kurram has remained isolated since last November, after authorities blocked key roads following sectarian violence. The closure has led to severe shortages of medicine and food, deepening a humanitarian crisis.In another incident, a bomb exploded outside a mosque in the northwestern city of Peshawar, killing a religious leader, local police said on Saturday. It was unclear who was behind the attack, and an investigation was being conducted.","Pakistani security forces raid two hideouts used by an armed group, triggering gun battles.

DHAKA: A fresh controversy convulsed Bangladesh on Friday after the National Citizen Party (NCP), launched by Nahid Islam - man who led the anti-Sheikh Hasina movement - alleged that efforts are being made by the ""army"" to relaunch the Awami League under a new name, "" Refined Awami League "", as part of an India-sponsored conspiracy.The allegations came on a day the army had to be deployed in Dhaka along with police in view of demonstrations by student groups and hardline Islamist organisation Hefazat-e-Islam to demand a ban on the Awami League. On Thursday, Bangladesh chief adviser Muhammad Yunus said there are no plans to ban the Awami League but individuals within its leadership will be tried for ""crimes against humanity"".In a Facebook post, NCP leader Hasnat Abdullah said the proposal for this ""Refined Awami League, led by Awami league members Saber Hossain Chowdhury, Shirin Sharmin Chaudhury and Fazle Noor Taposh"" was placed before him and two others on March 11 by ""the cantonment"", an apparent reference to the army.Referring to the last year ""July uprising"" that led to the ouster of the Hasina-led Awami League govt, he said, ""In July, your powerful movement helped us discard all prescriptions from cantonment and agencies. If you stand by us again today, if you join us on the streets, we will once again defeat this Indian conspiracy to rehabilitate the Awami League.""""We were asked to accept the proposal in exchange for a seat-sharing agreement for the next national election,"" Hasnat said, adding, ""at the cantonment, we were told that more than one political party has already been given this proposal, and they have agreed to the rehabilitation of the Awami League on certain conditions.""He did not tell who approached him. ""We were further told that those who will lead this 'Refined Awami League' will start publicly admitting to the crimes of the Sheikh family from April-May onwards, distancing themselves from Hasina while pledging allegiance only to Bangabandhu's Awami League.""

Khaleda Zia's party open to return of Sheikh Hasina's Awami League but with a condition,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/khaleda-zias-party-open-to-return-of-sheikh-hasinas-awami-league-but-with-a-condition/articleshow/119309200.cms,"Former prime minister Khaleda Zia 's Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) has stated it has no objection to the return of rival Sheikh Hasina’s Awami League to politics, provided it is under a clean leadership. This statement comes a day after the country’s interim government announced that it had no plans to ban the party.BNP spokesperson Ruhul Kabir Rizvi said that Awami League’s political comeback should be contingent on its leadership being free from criminal charges.“There should be no restriction on Awami League's return to politics if it selects a leader who is not guilty of any crime, has not killed students, and has not misappropriated or laundered money abroad,” Rizvi said, according to news agency PTI.He further added, “We have nothing to say if the people accept Awami League after a swift trial of those responsible for crimes committed under their regime.” However, he warned against the return of authoritarian rule, emphasizing that democracy should determine the party’s future.Rizvi’s remarks came after interim government chief Muhammad Yunus assured a delegation from the International Crisis Group that his administration ""has no plans to ban the Awami League."" However, he clarified that individuals within the party accused of serious crimes—including murder and crimes against humanity—would face prosecution in Bangladesh’s courts.Yunus also indicated that Awami League leaders could be referred to the International Criminal Court (ICC) following a UN fact-finding mission that uncovered potential crimes during the July-August 2024 protests, which led to Hasina’s ouster. ""It is very much on the table,"" he said.Hasina has been in India since August 5, 2024, after fleeing Bangladesh amid mass student-led protests that brought an end to her nearly 16-year rule. The Bangladesh International Crimes Tribunal (ICT) has issued arrest warrants against Hasina and several of her former ministers, advisers, and military and civil officials for “crimes against humanity and genocide.”The debate over Awami League’s future intensified on Friday as two student groups from Dhaka University—the Bangladesh Democratic Students' Council (BDSC) and Inquilab Mancha—held separate protests demanding the party be barred from contesting elections.The BNP, however, has consistently opposed banning political parties. Following Hasina’s removal, the Students Against Discrimination (SAD)—which spearheaded the protests—also pushed for Awami League’s exclusion from politics. Some SAD leaders later formed a political party, the National Citizen Party (NCP), which is advocating for the establishment of a ‘Second Republic’ and the abolition of Bangladesh’s 1972 constitution.One of NCP’s key leaders, Hasnat Abdullah, claimed in a Facebook post that there was a “conspiracy to rehabilitate Awami League” under a refined version, allegedly backed by India. He alleged that on March 11, he and two other NCP members were approached by military officials with a proposal to accept the “Refined Awami League” in exchange for a seat-sharing arrangement.“We were told that multiple political parties had already agreed to the proposal on certain conditions,” Abdullah claimed. “According to them, having several opposition parties, including a weak Awami League, is preferable to having a single strong opposition.”He said the NCP outright rejected the proposal, arguing that Awami League should face prosecution instead of rehabilitation. However, those who made the offer allegedly warned that SAD and NCP would have to bear responsibility for any political crisis resulting from their refusal.Jamaat-e-Islami (JeI), a former ally of BNP, has also backed NCP’s stance on Awami League. JeI chief Shafiqur Rahman asserted, “People will not accept the rehabilitation of Awami League.”As political tensions rise, calls for accountability and justice remain at the forefront of Bangladesh’s evolving political landscape.",Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) says it has no objection to Awami League's return to politics. BNP spokesperson Ruhul Kabir Rizvi said party's leadership should be free from criminal charges. Interim government chief Muhammad Yunus said he has no plans to ban the party.

Plans are underway to finalise and sign the July Charter, which will serve as a guiding framework for government policies in the coming months.""The International Crisis Group officials praised the arrest of Rohingya insurgent leader Ataullah this week, calling it a sign of the Interim Government's commitment to peace and stability in the refugee camps,"" the statement noted.The delegation also urged increased engagement with the Arakan Army, which controls much of Myanmar's Rakhine State. Professor Yunus acknowledged their concerns, stating that Bangladesh is working to mobilise humanitarian aid for Rohingya refugees. He expressed hope that the upcoming special UN conference on the Rohingya crisis would draw greater international attention to the ongoing humanitarian challenges.Comfort Ero expressed her group's support for Bangladesh in countering misinformation targeting the country and its Interim Government. In closing, Professor Yunus reiterated Bangladesh's desire for strong relations with India but lamented that much of the misinformation campaign against Bangladesh has originated from Indian media.","Bangladesh's Interim Government has no plans to ban the Awami League. Individuals within its leadership accused of crimes, including murder and crimes against humanity, will face trial. This follows a UN fact-finding mission report on potential crimes committed during July uprising.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-119293785,imgsize-1338425,width-400,resizemode-4/119293785.jpg"

Kabul : A 4.9-magnitude earthquake struck Afghanistan on Friday, according to the National Center for Seismology (NCS).The earthquake occurred at a depth of 160 km, as per NCS data.In a post on X, NCS stated, ""EQ of M: 4.9, On: 21/03/2025 01:00:57 IST, Lat: 36.48 N, Long: 71.45 E, Depth: 160 Km, Location: Afghanistan.Earlier on March 13, an earthquake of magnitude 4.0 jolted Afghanistan.As per the NCS, the earthquake occurred at a depth of 10km, making it susceptible to aftershocks.""EQ of M: 4.0, On: 13/03/2025 13:58:36 IST, Lat: 36.69 N, Long: 69.70 E, Depth: 10 Km, Location: Afghanistan,"" NCS noted.Shallow earthquakes like this one are more dangerous than deeper ones due to their greater energy release closer to the Earth's surface, causing stronger ground shaking and increased damage to structures and casualties, compared to deeper earthquakes, which lose energy as they travel to the surface.As per the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA), Afghanistan remains highly vulnerable to natural disasters, including seasonal flooding, landslides and earthquakes.These frequent earthquakes in Afghanistan cause damage to vulnerable communities, which are already grappling with decades of conflict and under-development and have left them with little resilience to cope with multiple simultaneous shocks, UNOCHA noted.Afghanistan has a history of powerful earthquakes, and the Hindu Kush Mountain range is a geologically active area where quakes occur every year, according to the Red Cross.Afghanistan sits on numerous fault lines between the Indian and the Eurasian tectonic plates, with a fault line also running directly through Herat.When earthquakes strike, their magnitude is important but also their depth, with shallow earthquakes wrecking more damage than those deeper into the Earth. Afghanistan is unfortunately prone to these shallow earthquakes, due to the region's tectonic plates often slipping past one another, as opposed to colliding directly.","A 4.9-magnitude earthquake struck Afghanistan on Friday, according to the National Center for Seismology (NCS) The earthquake occurred at a depth of 160 km, as per NCS data.

Bangladesh refuted Gabbard's claims as misleading, while Gabbard reiterated US concerns over minority persecution and Islamist terrorism.

What Bangladesh said on Gabbard's criticism



'US deeply concerned about persecution of minorities in Bangladesh': Tulsi



France embassy in Dhaka called a post ""ridiculous, baseless and intellectually weak statement"" which was claiming that they support Mohammad Yunus-led Bangladesh interim government's criticism against US intelligence chief Tulsi Gabbard on persecution of minorities in the country.Reacting to a post, France embassy said, ""How ridiculous, baseless and intellectually weak statement @kawsarc @mainul_haque @carmel_trish.""A former Navy official Manoj Rawat, sharing the screenshot of French embassy sharing the Yunus' statement on Gabbad's post in his post on X, claimed that they are supporting the Yunus Government 's criticism of Gabbard's statement on the genocide of Hindus in Bangladesh.He further said that it seems that the the Indo-French Strategic partnership is just a business arrangement for France to secure lucrative Defence contracts from India.""Time to call out the French mischief in the sub-continent,"" he said in a post on X.Bangladesh released a statement challenging Gabbard's observations, calling them ""misleading and damaging"" to the nation's standing.""This statement is both misleading and damaging to the image and reputation of Bangladesh, a nation whose traditional practice of Islam has been famously inclusive and peaceful, and that has made remarkable strides in its fight against extremism and terrorism,"" Bangladesh's interim government said in a statement.""Gabbard's comments are not based on any evidence or specific allegations. They paint an entire nation with a broad and unjustified brush. Bangladesh, like many countries around the world, has faced challenges with extremism, but it has continuously worked in partnership with the international community, including the US, to address these issues through law enforcement, social reforms, and other counterterrorism efforts. Bangladesh strongly condemns any efforts to link the country to any form of 'Islamist caliphate,"" the statement added.Bangladesh also urged Gabbard to base her statements on ""actual knowledge"" when discussing sensitive issues, warning that such remarks could reinforce harmful stereotypes.""Political leaders and public figures should base their statements, especially about the most sensitive issues, on actual knowledge and take care not to reinforce harmful stereotypes, to fan fears, and potentially even stoke sectarian tensions,"" the statement said.In media interviews later, Gabbard said the US was deeply concerned about the persecution of minorities in Bangladesh and the Trump administration was committed to defeat ""Islamist terrorism"" globally. She noted that PM Modi also took this threat seriously and added that the two leaders would work together to identify and defeat the threat.""The long-time unfortunate persecution, killing and abuse of religious minorities like Hindus, Buddhists, Christians and others has been a major area of concern for the US govt and President Trump and his administration,"" Gabbard told NDTV World.She spoke about the ideology of an ""Islamic Caliphate"" and how extremist elements and terror groups globally aimed for such an outcome. ""The threat of Islamist terrorists and the global effort of different terror groups are routed in the same ideology and objective - which is to rule or govern with an Islamist Caliphate,"" she said, adding, ""This obviously affects people of any other religion, other than the one that they find acceptable, and they choose to carry this out with terror and very violent ways and means.""Her remarks mark a strong indictment of Mohammad Yunus-led interim dispensation in Dhaka which had enjoyed support from the Biden administration. In her meeting with Singh, Gabbard reaffirmed the growing strength of the India-US bilateral defence partnership, drawing from the joint statement issued after the recent Modi-Trump meeting in DC, while laying emphasis on intelligence-sharing.","France embassy in Dhaka called a post ""ridiculous, baseless and intellectually weak statement"" which was claiming that they support Mohammad Yunus-led Bangladesh interim government's criticism against US intelligence chief Tulsi Gabbard on persecution of minorities in the country.

The Dalai Lama’s succession has long been a point of contention between Tibetans and China, but his latest statement has escalated the dispute. In his newly published book,, the 89-year-old Tibetan spiritual leader has explicitly stated for the first time that his successor will be born in the ""free world""—outside of China. This defies Beijing’s longstanding claim that it has the sole right to choose the next Dalai Lama.For China, controlling the Dalai Lama’s succession is about more than religion—it’s about political authority and maintaining control over Tibet. The Dalai Lama, who fled to India in 1959 after a failed uprising against Chinese rule, has long been regarded as a “separatist” by Beijing. With his 90th birthday approaching in July, the question of who will succeed him has become urgent, as it could determine the future of Tibetan Buddhism and Tibet’s political movement. Below, we break down the key issues surrounding this controversy.Also read: ‘Will be born in free world’: Dalai Lama declares successor will be born outside China; Beijing counters China considers the Dalai Lama to be a symbol of Tibetan resistance and fears that an independent successor could fuel separatist sentiments. By controlling the reincarnation process, Beijing hopes to install a Dalai Lama loyal to the Chinese government, ensuring tighter control over Tibet. The current Dalai Lama, however, has made it clear that any successor appointed by China will not be respected by Tibetans:According to Tibetan Buddhist tradition, the Dalai Lama is reincarnated, and his successor is identified by senior monks through visions, signs, and tests. Historically, this process has been free from political interference. However, China insists that it has the final say, citing historical conventions:– Mao Ning, Chinese foreign ministry spokespersonIn, the Dalai Lama explains that his successor must be free from Chinese control to continue his spiritual and humanitarian mission:This move is intended to prevent China from appointing a successor who would serve its political interests rather than uphold the spiritual and cultural values of Tibetan Buddhism.Beijing has dismissed the Dalai Lama’s remarks, insisting that it alone has the authority to choose his successor. The Chinese Foreign Ministry called him:They also reiterated that the reincarnation must follow government regulations:The controversy over the Panchen Lama—a senior figure in Tibetan Buddhism—illustrates China’s approach to religious succession. In 1995, the Dalai Lama identified a six-year-old boy, Gedhun Choekyi Nyima, as the 11th Panchen Lama. Shortly after, the Chinese government abducted the child and appointed its own Panchen Lama, Gyaltsen Norbu, who is seen by many Tibetans as illegitimate.The original Panchen Lama has not been seen since, with China claiming that he is now living a ""normal life."" This fuels fears that Beijing will follow the same strategy with the next Dalai Lama.If China installs a Dalai Lama of its choosing, Tibetans and the global Buddhist community are unlikely to accept him. This could lead to two rival Dalai Lamas—one recognized by Tibetans in exile and another by China. The Dalai Lama himself has warned:A divided leadership could deepen the Tibetan resistance against Chinese rule and further strain China’s relations with the international community.The dispute over the Dalai Lama’s succession has global implications, especially for China’s relations with India and the US.Beijing has condemned such foreign involvement as an attempt to destabilize China.In, the Dalai Lama expresses concern over Tibet’s fate under Chinese rule but remains hopeful:He also reaffirmed that the struggle for Tibetan freedom will continue beyond his lifetime:(With inputs from agencies)","Dalai Lama says his successor will be born in the ""free world""—outside of China.

United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres on Friday called for urgent international support for Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh, warning that cuts in humanitarian aid could lead to a disaster.Speaking at a joint press briefing in Dhaka during his four-day visit to Bangladesh, Guterres urged the international community to provide financial and political assistance to both the refugees and their host communities.""I strongly appeal to the international community to allow us to avoid any tragedy,"" he said. He also praised Bangladesh's “extraordinary generosity” in sheltering more than one million Rohingya refugees and described it as a testament to the country’s humanitarian spirit.Guterres visited Cox’s Bazar, where most of the Rohingya refugees live in overcrowded camps, and described the impact of global aid cuts on vulnerable populations as “a crime”, reported AP.He criticised the United States and European countries for slashing humanitarian assistance while increasing defence budgets.According to AP, the UN’s World Food Programme (WFP) has warned that without urgent funding, food rations for Rohingya refugees could be cut by half next month. A recent WFP letter stated that $81 million is needed to sustain operations until the end of the year, including $15 million for April alone.Guterres assured that the UN will continue efforts to secure funding and stressed that Rohingya refugees must not be forgotten. ""We cannot accept that the international community forgets about the Rohingya,"" he said.Bangladesh’s Chief Adviser Muhammad Yunus met with Guterres and urged the UN to mobilise humanitarian aid and support the repatriation of Rohingya refugees to Myanmar, which he described as the ultimate solution.""We are trying to raise attention to the plight of the Rohingya people. The world should know how they are suffering. There is a feeling of frustration,"" Yunus was quoted as saying by AP.Guterres emphasised that Myanmar remains the homeland of the Rohingya and called on all parties in Myanmar to ensure their safe and voluntary return. ""My message to all parties in Myanmar is clear: exercise maximum restraint, prioritise the protection of civilians, and create conditions for the Rohingya to return home,"" he said, as per PTI.Bangladesh has consistently maintained that repatriation is the only long-term solution, but efforts have stalled due to ongoing political instability in Myanmar. The Buddhist-majority nation has been accused of genocide against the Rohingya in an international court.As per ANI, Guterres reaffirmed the UN’s commitment to advocating for Rohingya rights and ensuring that they receive humanitarian assistance.He also attended a photo exhibition in Dhaka, interacted with youth and civil society members, and held a joint press conference with foreign adviser Touhid Hossain.His visit will conclude with an iftar hosted by the chief adviser before he departs from Dhaka on March 16.","United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres on Friday called for urgent international support for Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh.
